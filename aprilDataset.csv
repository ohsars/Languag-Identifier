" Nature, in the broadest sense, is the natural, physical, material world or universe.","Not Yoruba"
"""Nature"" can refer to the phenomena of the physical world, and also to life in general.","Not Yoruba"
"The study of nature is a large, if not the only, part of science.","Not Yoruba"
"Although humans are part of nature, human activity is often understood as a separate category from other natural phenomena.","Not Yoruba"
"[1] The word nature is borrowed from the Old French nature and is derived from the Latin word natura, or ""essential qualities, innate disposition"", and in ancient times, literally meant ""birth"".","Not Yoruba"
"[2] In ancient philosophy, natura is mostly used as the Latin translation of the Greek word physis (φύσις), which originally related to the intrinsic characteristics that plants, animals, and other features of the world develop of their own accord.","Not Yoruba"
"[3][4] 
The concept of nature as a whole, the physical universe, is one of several expansions of the original notion;[1] it began with certain core applications of the word φύσις by pre-Socratic philosophers (though this word had a dynamic dimension then, especially for Heraclitus), and has steadily gained currency ever since.","Not Yoruba"
"During the advent of modern scientific method in the last several centuries, nature became the passive reality, organized and moved by divine laws.","Not Yoruba"
"[5][6] With the Industrial revolution, nature increasingly became seen as the part of reality deprived from intentional intervention : it was hence considered as sacred by some traditions (Rousseau, American transcendentalism) or a mere decorum for divine providence or human history (Hegel, Marx).","Not Yoruba"
"However, a vitalist vision of nature, closer to the presocratic one, got reborn at the same time, especially after Charles Darwin.","Not Yoruba"
"[1] Within the various uses of the word today, ""nature"" often refers to geology and wildlife.","Not Yoruba"
"Nature can refer to the general realm of living plants and animals, and in some cases to the processes associated with inanimate objects—the way that particular types of things exist and change of their own accord, such as the weather and geology of the Earth.","Not Yoruba"
"It is often taken to mean the ""natural environment"" or wilderness—wild animals, rocks, forest, and in general those things that have not been substantially altered by human intervention, or which persist despite human intervention.","Not Yoruba"
"For example, manufactured objects and human interaction generally are not considered part of nature, unless qualified as, for example, ""human nature"" or ""the whole of nature"".","Not Yoruba"
"This more traditional concept of natural things that can still be found today implies a distinction between the natural and the artificial, with the artificial being understood as that which has been brought into being by a human consciousness or a human mind.","Not Yoruba"
"Depending on the particular context, the term ""natural"" might also be distinguished from the unnatural or the supernatural.","Not Yoruba"
"[1] Earth is the only planet known to support life, and its natural features are the subject of many fields of scientific research.","Not Yoruba"
"Within the solar system, it is third closest to the sun; it is the largest terrestrial planet and the fifth largest overall.","Not Yoruba"
"Its most prominent climatic features are its two large polar regions, two relatively narrow temperate zones, and a wide equatorial tropical to subtropical region.","Not Yoruba"
"[7] Precipitation varies widely with location, from several metres of water per year to less than a millimetre.","Not Yoruba"
"71 percent of the Earth's surface is covered by salt-water oceans.","Not Yoruba"
"The remainder consists of continents and islands, with most of the inhabited land in the Northern Hemisphere.","Not Yoruba"
"Earth has evolved through geological and biological processes that have left traces of the original conditions.","Not Yoruba"
"The outer surface is divided into several gradually migrating tectonic plates.","Not Yoruba"
"The interior remains active, with a thick layer of plastic mantle and an iron-filled core that generates a magnetic field.","Not Yoruba"
"This iron core is composed of a solid inner phase, and a fluid outer phase.","Not Yoruba"
"Convective motion in the core generates electric currents through dynamo action, and these, in turn, generate the geomagnetic field.","Not Yoruba"
"The atmospheric conditions have been significantly altered from the original conditions by the presence of life-forms,[8] which create an ecological balance that stabilizes the surface conditions.","Not Yoruba"
"Despite the wide regional variations in climate by latitude and other geographic factors, the long-term average global climate is quite stable during interglacial periods,[9] and variations of a degree or two of average global temperature have historically had major effects on the ecological balance, and on the actual geography of the Earth.","Not Yoruba"
"[10][11] Geology is the science and study of the solid and liquid matter that constitutes the earth.","Not Yoruba"
"The field of geology encompasses the study of the composition, structure, physical properties, dynamics, and history of Earth materials, and the processes by which they are formed, moved, and changed.","Not Yoruba"
"The field is a major academic discipline, and is also important for mineral and hydrocarbon extraction, knowledge about and mitigation of natural hazards, some Geotechnical engineering fields, and understanding past climates and environments.","Not Yoruba"
"The geology of an area evolves through time as rock units are deposited and inserted and deformational processes change their shapes and locations.","Not Yoruba"
"Rock units are first emplaced either by deposition onto the surface or intrude into the overlying rock.","Not Yoruba"
"Deposition can occur when sediments settle onto the surface of the Earth and later lithify into sedimentary rock, or when as volcanic material such as volcanic ash or lava flows, blanket the surface.","Not Yoruba"
"Igneous intrusions such as batholiths, laccoliths, dikes, and sills, push upwards into the overlying rock, and crystallize as they intrude.","Not Yoruba"
"After the initial sequence of rocks has been deposited, the rock units can be deformed and/or metamorphosed.","Not Yoruba"
"Deformation typically occurs as a result of horizontal shortening, horizontal extension, or side-to-side (strike-slip) motion.","Not Yoruba"
"These structural regimes broadly relate to convergent boundaries, divergent boundaries, and transform boundaries, respectively, between tectonic plates.","Not Yoruba"
"Earth is estimated to have formed 4.54 billion years ago from the solar nebula, along with the Sun and other planets.","Not Yoruba"
"[12] The moon formed roughly 20 million years later.","Not Yoruba"
"Initially molten, the outer layer of the Earth cooled, resulting in the solid crust.","Not Yoruba"
"Outgassing and volcanic activity produced the primordial atmosphere.","Not Yoruba"
"Condensing water vapor, most or all of which came from ice delivered by comets, produced the oceans and other water sources.","Not Yoruba"
"[13] The highly energetic chemistry is believed to have produced a self-replicating molecule around 4 billion years ago.","Not Yoruba"
"[14] Continents formed, then broke up and reformed as the surface of Earth reshaped over hundreds of millions of years, occasionally combining to make a supercontinent.","Not Yoruba"
"Roughly 750 million years ago, the earliest known supercontinent Rodinia, began to break apart.","Not Yoruba"
"The continents later recombined to form Pannotia which broke apart about 540 million years ago, then finally Pangaea, which broke apart about 180 million years ago.","Not Yoruba"
"[16] During the Neoproterozoic era, freezing temperatures covered much of the Earth in glaciers and ice sheets.","Not Yoruba"
"This hypothesis has been termed the ""Snowball Earth"", and it is of particular interest as it precedes the Cambrian explosion in which multicellular life forms began to proliferate about 530–540 million years ago.","Not Yoruba"
"[17] Since the Cambrian explosion there have been five distinctly identifiable mass extinctions.","Not Yoruba"
"[18] The last mass extinction occurred some 66 million years ago, when a meteorite collision probably triggered the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs and other large reptiles, but spared small animals such as mammals.","Not Yoruba"
"Over the past 66 million years, mammalian life diversified.","Not Yoruba"
"[19] Several million years ago, a species of small African ape gained the ability to stand upright.","Not Yoruba"
"[15] The subsequent advent of human life, and the development of agriculture and further civilization allowed humans to affect the Earth more rapidly than any previous life form, affecting both the nature and quantity of other organisms as well as global climate.","Not Yoruba"
"By comparison, the Great Oxygenation Event, produced by the proliferation of algae during the Siderian period, required about 300 million years to culminate.","Not Yoruba"
"The present era is classified as part of a mass extinction event, the Holocene extinction event, the fastest ever to have occurred.","Not Yoruba"
"[20][21] Some, such as E. O. Wilson of Harvard University, predict that human destruction of the biosphere could cause the extinction of one-half of all species in the next 100 years.","Not Yoruba"
"[22] The extent of the current extinction event is still being researched, debated and calculated by biologists.","Not Yoruba"
"[23][24][25] The Earth's atmosphere is a key factor in sustaining the ecosystem.","Not Yoruba"
"The thin layer of gases that envelops the Earth is held in place by gravity.","Not Yoruba"
"Air is mostly nitrogen, oxygen, water vapor, with much smaller amounts of carbon dioxide, argon, etc.","Not Yoruba"
"The atmospheric pressure declines steadily with altitude.","Not Yoruba"
"The ozone layer plays an important role in depleting the amount of ultraviolet (UV) radiation that reaches the surface.","Not Yoruba"
"As DNA is readily damaged by UV light, this serves to protect life at the surface.","Not Yoruba"
"The atmosphere also retains heat during the night, thereby reducing the daily temperature extremes.","Not Yoruba"
"Terrestrial weather occurs almost exclusively in the lower part of the atmosphere, and serves as a convective system for redistributing heat.","Not Yoruba"
"[26] Ocean currents are another important factor in determining climate, particularly the major underwater thermohaline circulation which distributes heat energy from the equatorial oceans to the polar regions.","Not Yoruba"
"These currents help to moderate the differences in temperature between winter and summer in the temperate zones.","Not Yoruba"
"Also, without the redistributions of heat energy by the ocean currents and atmosphere, the tropics would be much hotter, and the polar regions much colder.","Not Yoruba"
"Weather can have both beneficial and harmful effects.","Not Yoruba"
"Extremes in weather, such as tornadoes or hurricanes and cyclones, can expend large amounts of energy along their paths, and produce devastation.","Not Yoruba"
"Surface vegetation has evolved a dependence on the seasonal variation of the weather, and sudden changes lasting only a few years can have a dramatic effect, both on the vegetation and on the animals which depend on its growth for their food.","Not Yoruba"
"Climate is a measure of the long-term trends in the weather.","Not Yoruba"
"Various factors are known to influence the climate, including ocean currents, surface albedo, greenhouse gases, variations in the solar luminosity, and changes to the Earth's orbit.","Not Yoruba"
"Based on historical records, the Earth is known to have undergone drastic climate changes in the past, including ice ages.","Not Yoruba"
"The climate of a region depends on a number of factors, especially latitude.","Not Yoruba"
"A latitudinal band of the surface with similar climatic attributes forms a climate region.","Not Yoruba"
"There are a number of such regions, ranging from the tropical climate at the equator to the polar climate in the northern and southern extremes.","Not Yoruba"
"Weather is also influenced by the seasons, which result from the Earth's axis being tilted relative to its orbital plane.","Not Yoruba"
"Thus, at any given time during the summer or winter, one part of the Earth is more directly exposed to the rays of the sun.","Not Yoruba"
"This exposure alternates as the Earth revolves in its orbit.","Not Yoruba"
"At any given time, regardless of season, the northern and southern hemispheres experience opposite seasons.","Not Yoruba"
"Weather is a chaotic system that is readily modified by small changes to the environment, so accurate weather forecasting is limited to only a few days.","Not Yoruba"
"[27] Overall, two things are happening worldwide: (1) temperature is increasing on the average; and (2) regional climates have been undergoing noticeable changes.","Not Yoruba"
"[28] Water is a chemical substance that is composed of hydrogen and oxygen (H2O) and is vital for all known forms of life.","Not Yoruba"
"[29] In typical usage, water refers only to its liquid form or state, but the substance also has a solid state, ice, and a gaseous state, water vapor, or steam.","Not Yoruba"
"Water covers 71% of the Earth's surface.","Not Yoruba"
"[30] On Earth, it is found mostly in oceans and other large bodies of water, with 1.6% of water below ground in aquifers and 0.001% in the air as vapor, clouds, and precipitation.","Not Yoruba"
"[31][32] Oceans hold 97% of surface water, glaciers, and polar ice caps 2.4%, and other land surface water such as rivers, lakes, and ponds 0.6%.","Not Yoruba"
"Additionally, a minute amount of the Earth's water is contained within biological bodies and manufactured products.","Not Yoruba"
"An ocean is a major body of saline water, and a principal component of the hydrosphere.","Not Yoruba"
"Approximately 71% of the Earth's surface (an area of some 361 million square kilometers) is covered by ocean, a continuous body of water that is customarily divided into several principal oceans and smaller seas.","Not Yoruba"
"More than half of this area is over 3,000 meters (9,800 feet) deep.","Not Yoruba"
"Average oceanic salinity is around 35 parts per thousand (ppt) (3.5%), and nearly all seawater has a salinity in the range of 30 to 38 ppt.","Not Yoruba"
"Though generally recognized as several 'separate' oceans, these waters comprise one global, interconnected body of salt water often referred to as the World Ocean or global ocean.","Not Yoruba"
"[33][34] This concept of a global ocean as a continuous body of water with relatively free interchange among its parts is of fundamental importance to oceanography.","Not Yoruba"
"[35] The major oceanic divisions are defined in part by the continents, various archipelagos, and other criteria: these divisions are (in descending order of size) the Pacific Ocean, the Atlantic Ocean, the Indian Ocean, the Southern Ocean, and the Arctic Ocean.","Not Yoruba"
"Smaller regions of the oceans are called seas, gulfs, bays and other names.","Not Yoruba"
"There are also salt lakes, which are smaller bodies of landlocked saltwater that are not interconnected with the World Ocean.","Not Yoruba"
"Two notable examples of salt lakes are the Aral Sea and the Great Salt Lake.","Not Yoruba"
"A lake (from Latin word lacus) is a terrain feature (or physical feature), a body of liquid on the surface of a world that is localized to the bottom of basin (another type of landform or terrain feature; that is, it is not global) and moves slowly if it moves at all.","Not Yoruba"
"On Earth, a body of water is considered a lake when it is inland, not part of the ocean, is larger and deeper than a pond, and is fed by a river.","Not Yoruba"
"[36][37] The only world other than Earth known to harbor lakes is Titan, Saturn's largest moon, which has lakes of ethane, most likely mixed with methane.","Not Yoruba"
"It is not known if Titan's lakes are fed by rivers, though Titan's surface is carved by numerous river beds.","Not Yoruba"
"Natural lakes on Earth are generally found in mountainous areas, rift zones, and areas with ongoing or recent glaciation.","Not Yoruba"
"Other lakes are found in endorheic basins or along the courses of mature rivers.","Not Yoruba"
"In some parts of the world, there are many lakes because of chaotic drainage patterns left over from the last Ice Age.","Not Yoruba"
"All lakes are temporary over geologic time scales, as they will slowly fill in with sediments or spill out of the basin containing them.","Not Yoruba"
"A pond is a body of standing water, either natural or man-made, that is usually smaller than a lake.","Not Yoruba"
"A wide variety of man-made bodies of water are classified as ponds, including water gardens designed for aesthetic ornamentation, fish ponds designed for commercial fish breeding, and solar ponds designed to store thermal energy.","Not Yoruba"
"Ponds and lakes are distinguished from streams via current speed.","Not Yoruba"
"While currents in streams are easily observed, ponds and lakes possess thermally driven micro-currents and moderate wind driven currents.","Not Yoruba"
"These features distinguish a pond from many other aquatic terrain features, such as stream pools and tide pools.","Not Yoruba"
"A river is a natural watercourse,[38] usually freshwater, flowing towards an ocean, a lake, a sea or another river.","Not Yoruba"
"In a few cases, a river simply flows into the ground or dries up completely before reaching another body of water.","Not Yoruba"
"Small rivers may also be called by several other names, including stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill; there is no general rule that defines what can be called a river.","Not Yoruba"
"Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; one example is Burn in Scotland and North-east England.","Not Yoruba"
"Sometimes a river is said to be larger than a creek, but this is not always the case, due to vagueness in the language.","Not Yoruba"
"[39] A river is part of the hydrological cycle.","Not Yoruba"
"Water within a river is generally collected from precipitation through surface runoff, groundwater recharge, springs, and the release of stored water in natural ice and snowpacks (i.e., from glaciers).","Not Yoruba"
"A stream is a flowing body of water with a current, confined within a bed and stream banks.","Not Yoruba"
"In the United States, a stream is classified as a watercourse less than 60 feet (18 metres) wide.","Not Yoruba"
"Streams are important as conduits in the water cycle, instruments in groundwater recharge, and they serve as corridors for fish and wildlife migration.","Not Yoruba"
"The biological habitat in the immediate vicinity of a stream is called a riparian zone.","Not Yoruba"
"Given the status of the ongoing Holocene extinction, streams play an important corridor role in connecting fragmented habitats and thus in conserving biodiversity.","Not Yoruba"
"The study of streams and waterways in general involves many branches of inter-disciplinary natural science and engineering, including hydrology, fluvial geomorphology, aquatic ecology, fish biology, riparian ecology, and others.","Not Yoruba"
"Ecosystems are composed of a variety of biotic and abiotic components that function in an interrelated way.","Not Yoruba"
"[41] The structure and composition is determined by various environmental factors that are interrelated.","Not Yoruba"
"Variations of these factors will initiate dynamic modifications to the ecosystem.","Not Yoruba"
"Some of the more important components are soil, atmosphere, radiation from the sun, water, and living organisms.","Not Yoruba"
"Central to the ecosystem concept is the idea that living organisms interact with every other element in their local environment.","Not Yoruba"
"Eugene Odum, a founder of ecology, stated: ""Any unit that includes all of the organisms (ie: the ""community"") in a given area interacting with the physical environment so that a flow of energy leads to clearly defined trophic structure, biotic diversity, and material cycles (i.e.","Not Yoruba"
": exchange of materials between living and nonliving parts) within the system is an ecosystem.","Not Yoruba"
"""[42] Within the ecosystem, species are connected and dependent upon one another in the food chain, and exchange energy and matter between themselves as well as with their environment.","Not Yoruba"
"[43] The human ecosystem concept is based on the human/nature dichotomy and the idea that all species are ecologically dependent on each other, as well as with the abiotic constituents of their biotope.","Not Yoruba"
"[44] A smaller unit of size is called a microecosystem.","Not Yoruba"
"For example, a microsystem can be a stone and all the life under it.","Not Yoruba"
"A macroecosystem might involve a whole ecoregion, with its drainage basin.","Not Yoruba"
"[45] Wilderness is generally defined as areas that have not been significantly modified by human activity.","Not Yoruba"
"Wilderness areas can be found in preserves, estates, farms, conservation preserves, ranches, national forests, national parks, and even in urban areas along rivers, gulches, or otherwise undeveloped areas.","Not Yoruba"
"Wilderness areas and protected parks are considered important for the survival of certain species, ecological studies, conservation, and solitude.","Not Yoruba"
"Some nature writers believe wilderness areas are vital for the human spirit and creativity,[46] and some ecologists consider wilderness areas to be an integral part of the Earth's self-sustaining natural ecosystem (the biosphere).","Not Yoruba"
"They may also preserve historic genetic traits and that they provide habitat for wild flora and fauna that may be difficult or impossible to recreate in zoos, arboretums, or laboratories.","Not Yoruba"
"Although there is no universal agreement on the definition of life, scientists generally accept that the biological manifestation of life is characterized by organization, metabolism, growth, adaptation, response to stimuli, and reproduction.","Not Yoruba"
"[47] Life may also be said to be simply the characteristic state of organisms.","Not Yoruba"
"Properties common to terrestrial organisms (plants, animals, fungi, protists, archaea, and bacteria) are that they are cellular, carbon-and-water-based with complex organization, having a metabolism, a capacity to grow, respond to stimuli, and reproduce.","Not Yoruba"
"An entity with these properties is generally considered life.","Not Yoruba"
"However, not every definition of life considers all of these properties to be essential.","Not Yoruba"
"Human-made analogs of life may also be considered to be life.","Not Yoruba"
"The biosphere is the part of Earth's outer shell—including land, surface rocks, water, air and the atmosphere—within which life occurs, and which biotic processes in turn alter or transform.","Not Yoruba"
"From the broadest geophysiological point of view, the biosphere is the global ecological system integrating all living beings and their relationships, including their interaction with the elements of the lithosphere (rocks), hydrosphere (water), and atmosphere (air).","Not Yoruba"
"The entire Earth contains over 75 billion tons (150 trillion pounds or about 6.8×1013 kilograms) of biomass (life), which lives within various environments within the biosphere.","Not Yoruba"
"[48] Over nine-tenths of the total biomass on Earth is plant life, on which animal life depends very heavily for its existence.","Not Yoruba"
"[49] More than 2 million species of plant and animal life have been identified to date,[50] and estimates of the actual number of existing species range from several million to well over 50 million.","Not Yoruba"
"[51][52][53] The number of individual species of life is constantly in some degree of flux, with new species appearing and others ceasing to exist on a continual basis.","Not Yoruba"
"[54][55] The total number of species is in rapid decline.","Not Yoruba"
"[56][57][58] The origin of life on Earth is not well understood, but it is known to have occurred at least 3.5 billion years ago,[61][62][63] during the hadean or archean eons on a primordial Earth that had a substantially different environment than is found at present.","Not Yoruba"
"[64] These life forms possessed the basic traits of self-replication and inheritable traits.","Not Yoruba"
"Once life had appeared, the process of evolution by natural selection resulted in the development of ever-more diverse life forms.","Not Yoruba"
"Species that were unable to adapt to the changing environment and competition from other life forms became extinct.","Not Yoruba"
"However, the fossil record retains evidence of many of these older species.","Not Yoruba"
"Current fossil and DNA evidence shows that all existing species can trace a continual ancestry back to the first primitive life forms.","Not Yoruba"
"[64] When basic forms of plant life developed the process of photosynthesis the sun's energy could be harvested to create conditions which allowed for more complex life forms.","Not Yoruba"
"[65] The resultant oxygen accumulated in the atmosphere and gave rise to the ozone layer.","Not Yoruba"
"The incorporation of smaller cells within larger ones resulted in the development of yet more complex cells called eukaryotes.","Not Yoruba"
"[66] Cells within colonies became increasingly specialized, resulting in true multicellular organisms.","Not Yoruba"
"With the ozone layer absorbing harmful ultraviolet radiation, life colonized the surface of Earth.","Not Yoruba"
"The first form of life to develop on the Earth were microbes, and they remained the only form of life until about a billion years ago when multi-cellular organisms began to appear.","Not Yoruba"
"[67] Microorganisms are single-celled organisms that are generally microscopic, and smaller than the human eye can see.","Not Yoruba"
"They include Bacteria, Fungi, Archaea, and Protista.","Not Yoruba"
"These life forms are found in almost every location on the Earth where there is liquid water, including in the Earth's interior.","Not Yoruba"
"[68]
Their reproduction is both rapid and profuse.","Not Yoruba"
"The combination of a high mutation rate and a horizontal gene transfer[69] ability makes them highly adaptable, and able to survive in new environments, including outer space.","Not Yoruba"
"[70] They form an essential part of the planetary ecosystem.","Not Yoruba"
"However, some microorganisms are pathogenic and can post health risk to other organisms.","Not Yoruba"
"Originally Aristotle divided all living things between plants, which generally do not move fast enough for humans to notice, and animals.","Not Yoruba"
"In Linnaeus' system, these became the kingdoms Vegetabilia (later Plantae) and Animalia.","Not Yoruba"
"Since then, it has become clear that the Plantae as originally defined included several unrelated groups, and the fungi and several groups of algae were removed to new kingdoms.","Not Yoruba"
"However, these are still often considered plants in many contexts.","Not Yoruba"
"Bacterial life is sometimes included in flora,[71][72] and some classifications use the term bacterial flora separately from plant flora.","Not Yoruba"
"Among the many ways of classifying plants are by regional floras, which, depending on the purpose of study, can also include fossil flora, remnants of plant life from a previous era.","Not Yoruba"
"People in many regions and countries take great pride in their individual arrays of characteristic flora, which can vary widely across the globe due to differences in climate and terrain.","Not Yoruba"
"Regional floras commonly are divided into categories such as native flora and agricultural and garden flora, the lastly mentioned of which are intentionally grown and cultivated.","Not Yoruba"
"Some types of ""native flora"" actually have been introduced centuries ago by people migrating from one region or continent to another, and become an integral part of the native, or natural flora of the place to which they were introduced.","Not Yoruba"
"This is an example of how human interaction with nature can blur the boundary of what is considered nature.","Not Yoruba"
"Another category of plant has historically been carved out for weeds.","Not Yoruba"
"Though the term has fallen into disfavor among botanists as a formal way to categorize ""useless"" plants, the informal use of the word ""weeds"" to describe those plants that are deemed worthy of elimination is illustrative of the general tendency of people and societies to seek to alter or shape the course of nature.","Not Yoruba"
"Similarly, animals are often categorized in ways such as domestic, farm animals, wild animals, pests, etc.","Not Yoruba"
"according to their relationship to human life.","Not Yoruba"
"Animals as a category have several characteristics that generally set them apart from other living things.","Not Yoruba"
"Animals are eukaryotic and usually multicellular (although see Myxozoa), which separates them from bacteria, archaea, and most protists.","Not Yoruba"
"They are heterotrophic, generally digesting food in an internal chamber, which separates them from plants and algae.","Not Yoruba"
"They are also distinguished from plants, algae, and fungi by lacking cell walls.","Not Yoruba"
"With a few exceptions—most notably the two phyla consisting of sponges and placozoans—animals have bodies that are differentiated into tissues.","Not Yoruba"
"These include muscles, which are able to contract and control locomotion, and a nervous system, which sends and processes signals.","Not Yoruba"
"There is also typically an internal digestive chamber.","Not Yoruba"
"The eukaryotic cells possessed by all animals are surrounded by a characteristic extracellular matrix composed of collagen and elastic glycoproteins.","Not Yoruba"
"This may be calcified to form structures like shells, bones, and spicules, a framework upon which cells can move about and be reorganized during development and maturation, and which supports the complex anatomy required for mobility.","Not Yoruba"
"Although humans comprise only a minuscule proportion of the total living biomass on Earth, the human effect on nature is disproportionately large.","Not Yoruba"
"Because of the extent of human influence, the boundaries between what humans regard as nature and ""made environments"" is not clear cut except at the extremes.","Not Yoruba"
"Even at the extremes, the amount of natural environment that is free of discernible human influence is diminishing at an increasingly rapid pace.","Not Yoruba"
"The development of technology by the human race has allowed the greater exploitation of natural resources and has helped to alleviate some of the risk from natural hazards.","Not Yoruba"
"In spite of this progress, however, the fate of human civilization remains closely linked to changes in the environment.","Not Yoruba"
"There exists a highly complex feedback loop between the use of advanced technology and changes to the environment that are only slowly becoming understood.","Not Yoruba"
"[73] Man-made threats to the Earth's natural environment include pollution, deforestation, and disasters such as oil spills.","Not Yoruba"
"Humans have contributed to the extinction of many plants and animals.","Not Yoruba"
"Humans employ nature for both leisure and economic activities.","Not Yoruba"
"The acquisition of natural resources for industrial use remains a sizable component of the world's economic system.","Not Yoruba"
"[74][75] Some activities, such as hunting and fishing, are used for both sustenance and leisure, often by different people.","Not Yoruba"
"Agriculture was first adopted around the 9th millennium BCE.","Not Yoruba"
"Ranging from food production to energy, nature influences economic wealth.","Not Yoruba"
"Although early humans gathered uncultivated plant materials for food and employed the medicinal properties of vegetation for healing,[76] most modern human use of plants is through agriculture.","Not Yoruba"
"The clearance of large tracts of land for crop growth has led to a significant reduction in the amount available of forestation and wetlands, resulting in the loss of habitat for many plant and animal species as well as increased erosion.","Not Yoruba"
"[77] Beauty in nature has historically been a prevalent theme in art and books, filling large sections of libraries and bookstores.","Not Yoruba"
"That nature has been depicted and celebrated by so much art, photography, poetry, and other literature shows the strength with which many people associate nature and beauty.","Not Yoruba"
"Reasons why this association exists, and what the association consists of, are studied by the branch of philosophy called aesthetics.","Not Yoruba"
"Beyond certain basic characteristics that many philosophers agree about to explain what is seen as beautiful, the opinions are virtually endless.","Not Yoruba"
"[78] Nature and wildness have been important subjects in various eras of world history.","Not Yoruba"
"An early tradition of landscape art began in China during the Tang Dynasty (618–907).","Not Yoruba"
"The tradition of representing nature as it is became one of the aims of Chinese painting and was a significant influence in Asian art.","Not Yoruba"
"Although natural wonders are celebrated in the Psalms and the Book of Job, wilderness portrayals in art became more prevalent in the 1800s, especially in the works of the Romantic movement.","Not Yoruba"
"British artists John Constable and J. M. W. Turner turned their attention to capturing the beauty of the natural world in their paintings.","Not Yoruba"
"Before that, paintings had been primarily of religious scenes or of human beings.","Not Yoruba"
"William Wordsworth's poetry described the wonder of the natural world, which had formerly been viewed as a threatening place.","Not Yoruba"
"Increasingly the valuing of nature became an aspect of Western culture.","Not Yoruba"
"[79] This artistic movement also coincided with the Transcendentalist movement in the Western world.","Not Yoruba"
"A common classical idea of beautiful art involves the word mimesis, the imitation of nature.","Not Yoruba"
"Also in the realm of ideas about beauty in nature is that the perfect is implied through perfect mathematical forms and more generally by patterns in nature.","Not Yoruba"
"As David Rothenburg writes, ""The beautiful is the root of science and the goal of art, the highest possibility that humanity can ever hope to see"".","Not Yoruba"
"[80]:281 Some fields of science see nature as matter in motion, obeying certain laws of nature which science seeks to understand.","Not Yoruba"
"For this reason the most fundamental science is generally understood to be ""physics""—the name for which is still recognizable as meaning that it is the ""study of nature"".","Not Yoruba"
"Matter is commonly defined as the substance of which physical objects are composed.","Not Yoruba"
"It constitutes the observable universe.","Not Yoruba"
"The visible components of the universe are now believed to compose only 4.9 percent of the total mass.","Not Yoruba"
"The remainder is believed to consist of 26.8 percent cold dark matter and 68.3 percent dark energy.","Not Yoruba"
"[81] The exact arrangement of these components is still unknown and is under intensive investigation by physicists.","Not Yoruba"
"The behaviour of matter and energy throughout the observable universe appears to follow well-defined physical laws.","Not Yoruba"
"These laws have been employed to produce cosmological models that successfully explain the structure and the evolution of the universe we can observe.","Not Yoruba"
"The mathematical expressions of the laws of physics employ a set of twenty physical constants[82] that appear to be static across the observable universe.","Not Yoruba"
"[83] The values of these constants have been carefully measured, but the reason for their specific values remains a mystery.","Not Yoruba"
"Outer space, also simply called space, refers to the relatively empty regions of the Universe outside the atmospheres of celestial bodies.","Not Yoruba"
"Outer space is used to distinguish it from airspace (and terrestrial locations).","Not Yoruba"
"There is no discrete boundary between Earth's atmosphere and space, as the atmosphere gradually attenuates with increasing altitude.","Not Yoruba"
"Outer space within the Solar System is called interplanetary space, which passes over into interstellar space at what is known as the heliopause.","Not Yoruba"
"Outer space is sparsely filled with several dozen types of organic molecules discovered to date by microwave spectroscopy, blackbody radiation left over from the Big Bang and the origin of the universe, and cosmic rays, which include ionized atomic nuclei and various subatomic particles.","Not Yoruba"
"There is also some gas, plasma and dust, and small meteors.","Not Yoruba"
"Additionally, there are signs of human life in outer space today, such as material left over from previous manned and unmanned launches which are a potential hazard to spacecraft.","Not Yoruba"
"Some of this debris re-enters the atmosphere periodically.","Not Yoruba"
"Although Earth is the only body within the solar system known to support life, evidence suggests that in the distant past the planet Mars possessed bodies of liquid water on the surface.","Not Yoruba"
"[84] For a brief period in Mars' history, it may have also been capable of forming life.","Not Yoruba"
"At present though, most of the water remaining on Mars is frozen.","Not Yoruba"
"If life exists at all on Mars, it is most likely to be located underground where liquid water can still exist.","Not Yoruba"
"[85] Conditions on the other terrestrial planets, Mercury and Venus, appear to be too harsh to support life as we know it.","Not Yoruba"
"But it has been conjectured that Europa, the fourth-largest moon of Jupiter, may possess a sub-surface ocean of liquid water and could potentially host life.","Not Yoruba"
"[86] Astronomers have started to discover extrasolar Earth analogs – planets that lie in the habitable zone of space surrounding a star, and therefore could possibly host life as we know it.","Not Yoruba"
"[87] Media: Organizations: Philosophy:   Wikipedia (/ˌwɪkɪˈpiːdiə/ (listen) wik-ih-PEE-dee-ə or /ˌwɪki-/ (listen) wik-ee-) is a multilingual open-collaborative online encyclopedia created and maintained by a community of volunteer editors using a wiki-based editing system.","Not Yoruba"
"It is one of the 15 most popular websites as ranked by Alexa, as of January 2021[update][3] and The Economist newspaper placed it as the ""13th-most-visited place on the web"".","Not Yoruba"
"[4] Featuring no advertisements, it is hosted by the Wikimedia Foundation, an American non-profit organization funded primarily through donations.","Not Yoruba"
"Wikipedia was launched on January 15, 2001, by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger.","Not Yoruba"
"Sanger coined its name[5][6] as a portmanteau of ""wiki"" and ""encyclopedia"".","Not Yoruba"
"It was initially an English-language encyclopedia, but versions in other languages were quickly developed.","Not Yoruba"
"With 6.2 million articles, the English Wikipedia is the largest of the 317 Wikipedia encyclopedias.","Not Yoruba"
"Overall, Wikipedia comprises more than 55 million articles,[7] attracting 1.7 billion unique visitors per month.","Not Yoruba"
"[8][9] Wikipedia has been criticized for its uneven accuracy and for exhibiting systemic bias, including gender bias, with the majority of editors being male.","Not Yoruba"
"[4] Edit-a-thons have been held to encourage female editors and increase the coverage of women's topics.","Not Yoruba"
"[10] In 2006, Time magazine stated that the open-door policy of allowing anyone to edit had made Wikipedia the biggest and possibly the best encyclopedia in the world, and was a testament to the vision of Jimmy Wales.","Not Yoruba"
"[11] The project's reputation improved further in the 2010s as it increased efforts to improve its quality and reliability, based on its unique structure, curation and absence of commercial bias.","Not Yoruba"
"[4] In 2018, Facebook and YouTube announced that they would help users detect fake news by suggesting links to related Wikipedia articles.","Not Yoruba"
"[12] Other collaborative online encyclopedias were attempted before Wikipedia, but none were as successful.","Not Yoruba"
"[13] Wikipedia began as a complementary project for Nupedia, a free online English-language encyclopedia project whose articles were written by experts and reviewed under a formal process.","Not Yoruba"
"[14] It was founded on March 9, 2000, under the ownership of Bomis, a web portal company.","Not Yoruba"
"Its main figures were Bomis CEO Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger, editor-in-chief for Nupedia and later Wikipedia.","Not Yoruba"
"[15][16] Nupedia was initially licensed under its own Nupedia Open Content License, but even before Wikipedia was founded, Nupedia switched to the GNU Free Documentation License at the urging of Richard Stallman.","Not Yoruba"
"[17] Wales is credited with defining the goal of making a publicly editable encyclopedia,[18][19] while Sanger is credited with the strategy of using a wiki to reach that goal.","Not Yoruba"
"[20] On January 10, 2001, Sanger proposed on the Nupedia mailing list to create a wiki as a ""feeder"" project for Nupedia.","Not Yoruba"
"[21] The domains wikipedia.com and wikipedia.org were registered on January 12, 2001,[22] and January 13, 2001,[23] respectively, and Wikipedia was launched on January 15, 2001,[14] as a single English-language edition at www.wikipedia.com,[24] and announced by Sanger on the Nupedia mailing list.","Not Yoruba"
"[18] Wikipedia's policy of ""neutral point-of-view""[25] was codified in its first few months.","Not Yoruba"
"Otherwise, there were relatively few rules initially and Wikipedia operated independently of Nupedia.","Not Yoruba"
"[18] Originally, Bomis intended to make Wikipedia a business for profit.","Not Yoruba"
"[26] Wikipedia gained early contributors from Nupedia, Slashdot postings, and web search engine indexing.","Not Yoruba"
"Language editions were also created, with a total of 161 by the end of 2004.","Not Yoruba"
"[27] Nupedia and Wikipedia coexisted until the former's servers were taken down permanently in 2003, and its text was incorporated into Wikipedia.","Not Yoruba"
"The English Wikipedia passed the mark of two million articles on September 9, 2007, making it the largest encyclopedia ever assembled, surpassing the Yongle Encyclopedia made during the Ming Dynasty in 1408, which had held the record for almost 600 years.","Not Yoruba"
"[28] Citing fears of commercial advertising and lack of control in Wikipedia, users of the Spanish Wikipedia forked from Wikipedia to create the Enciclopedia Libre in February 2002.","Not Yoruba"
"[29] Wales then announced that Wikipedia would not display advertisements, and changed Wikipedia's domain from wikipedia.com to wikipedia.org.","Not Yoruba"
"[30][31] Though the English Wikipedia reached three million articles in August 2009, the growth of the edition, in terms of the numbers of new articles and of contributors, appears to have peaked around early 2007.","Not Yoruba"
"[32] Around 1,800 articles were added daily to the encyclopedia in 2006; by 2013 that average was roughly 800.","Not Yoruba"
"[33] A team at the Palo Alto Research Center attributed this slowing of growth to the project's increasing exclusivity and resistance to change.","Not Yoruba"
"[34] Others suggest that the growth is flattening naturally because articles that could be called ""low-hanging fruit""—topics that clearly merit an article—have already been created and built up extensively.","Not Yoruba"
"[35][36][37]  In November 2009, a researcher at the Rey Juan Carlos University in Madrid found that the English Wikipedia had lost 49,000 editors during the first three months of 2009; in comparison, the project lost only 4,900 editors during the same period in 2008.","Not Yoruba"
"[38][39] The Wall Street Journal cited the array of rules applied to editing and disputes related to such content among the reasons for this trend.","Not Yoruba"
"[40] Wales disputed these claims in 2009, denying the decline and questioning the methodology of the study.","Not Yoruba"
"[41] Two years later, in 2011, Wales acknowledged the presence of a slight decline, noting a decrease from ""a little more than 36,000 writers"" in June 2010 to 35,800 in June 2011.","Not Yoruba"
"In the same interview, Wales also claimed the number of editors was ""stable and sustainable"".","Not Yoruba"
"[42] A 2013 article titled ""The Decline of Wikipedia"" in MIT Technology Review questioned this claim.","Not Yoruba"
"The article revealed that since 2007, Wikipedia had lost a third of its volunteer editors, and those still there have focused increasingly on minutiae.","Not Yoruba"
"[43] In July 2012, The Atlantic reported that the number of administrators is also in decline.","Not Yoruba"
"[44] In the November 25, 2013, issue of New York magazine, Katherine Ward stated ""Wikipedia, the sixth-most-used website, is facing an internal crisis"".","Not Yoruba"
"[45] In January 2007, Wikipedia entered for the first time the top-ten list of the most popular websites in the US, according to comscore Networks.","Not Yoruba"
"With 42.9 million unique visitors, Wikipedia was ranked number 9, surpassing The New York Times (#10) and Apple (#11).","Not Yoruba"

"[8] Loveland and Reagle argue that, in process, Wikipedia follows a long tradition of historical encyclopedias that accumulated improvements piecemeal through ""stigmergic accumulation"".","Not Yoruba"
"[48][49]  On January 18, 2012, the English Wikipedia participated in a series of coordinated protests against two proposed laws in the United States Congress—the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and the PROTECT IP Act (PIPA)—by blacking out its pages for 24 hours.","Not Yoruba"
"[50] More than 162 million people viewed the blackout explanation page that temporarily replaced Wikipedia content.","Not Yoruba"

"[55][56] In June 2019, scientists reported that all 16 GB of article text from the English Wikipedia have been encoded into synthetic DNA.","Not Yoruba"
"[57] Unlike traditional encyclopedias, Wikipedia follows the procrastination principle[note 3] regarding the security of its content.","Not Yoruba"
"[60] It started almost entirely open—anyone could create articles, and any Wikipedia article could be edited by any reader, even those who did not have a Wikipedia account.","Not Yoruba"
"Modifications to all articles would be published immediately.","Not Yoruba"
"As a result, any article could contain inaccuracies such as errors, ideological biases, and nonsensical or irrelevant text.","Not Yoruba"
"Due to the increasing popularity of Wikipedia, some editions, including the English version, have introduced editing restrictions for certain cases.","Not Yoruba"
"For instance, on the English Wikipedia and some other language editions, only registered users may create a new article.","Not Yoruba"
"[61] On the English Wikipedia, among others, particularly controversial, sensitive or vandalism-prone pages have been protected to varying degrees.","Not Yoruba"
"[62][63] A frequently vandalized article can be semi-protected or extended confirmed protected, meaning that only autoconfirmed or extended confirmed editors are able to modify it.","Not Yoruba"
"[64] A particularly contentious article may be locked so that only administrators are able to make changes.","Not Yoruba"
"[65] A 2021 article in the Columbia Journalism Review identified Wikipedia's page protection policies as ""[p]erhaps the most important"" means at Wikipedia's disposal to ""regulate its market of ideas"".","Not Yoruba"
"[66] In certain cases, all editors are allowed to submit modifications, but review is required for some editors, depending on certain conditions.","Not Yoruba"
"For example, the German Wikipedia maintains ""stable versions"" of articles,[67] which have passed certain reviews.","Not Yoruba"
"Following protracted trials and community discussion, the English Wikipedia introduced the ""pending changes"" system in December 2012.","Not Yoruba"
"[68] Under this system, new and unregistered users' edits to certain controversial or vandalism-prone articles are reviewed by established users before they are published.","Not Yoruba"
"[69] Although changes are not systematically reviewed, the software that powers Wikipedia provides tools allowing anyone to review changes made by others.","Not Yoruba"
"The ""History"" page of each article links to each revision.","Not Yoruba"
"[note 4][70] On most articles, anyone can undo others' changes by clicking a link on the article's history page.","Not Yoruba"
"Anyone can view the latest changes to articles, and anyone may maintain a ""watchlist"" of articles that interest them so they can be notified of any changes.","Not Yoruba"
"""New pages patrol"" is a process whereby newly created articles are checked for obvious problems.","Not Yoruba"
"[71] In 2003, economics Ph.D. student Andrea Ciffolilli argued that the low transaction costs of participating in a wiki create a catalyst for collaborative development, and that features such as allowing easy access to past versions of a page favor ""creative construction"" over ""creative destruction"".","Not Yoruba"
"[72] Any change or edit that manipulates content in a way that purposefully compromises the integrity of Wikipedia is considered vandalism.","Not Yoruba"
"The most common and obvious types of vandalism include additions of obscenities and crude humor.","Not Yoruba"
"Vandalism can also include advertising and other types of spam.","Not Yoruba"
"[73] Sometimes editors commit vandalism by removing content or entirely blanking a given page.","Not Yoruba"
"Less common types of vandalism, such as the deliberate addition of plausible but false information to an article can be more difficult to detect.","Not Yoruba"
"Vandals can introduce irrelevant formatting, modify page semantics such as the page's title or categorization, manipulate the underlying code of an article, or use images disruptively.","Not Yoruba"
"[74] Obvious vandalism is generally easy to remove from Wikipedia articles; the median time to detect and fix vandalism is a few minutes.","Not Yoruba"
"[75][76] However, some vandalism takes much longer to repair.","Not Yoruba"
"[77] In the Seigenthaler biography incident, an anonymous editor introduced false information into the biography of American political figure John Seigenthaler in May 2005.","Not Yoruba"
"Seigenthaler was falsely presented as a suspect in the assassination of John F.","Not Yoruba"
"Kennedy.","Not Yoruba"
"[77] The article remained uncorrected for four months.","Not Yoruba"
"[77] Seigenthaler, the founding editorial director of USA Today and founder of the Freedom Forum First Amendment Center at Vanderbilt University, called Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales and asked whether he had any way of knowing who contributed the misinformation.","Not Yoruba"
"Wales replied that he did not, although the perpetrator was eventually traced.","Not Yoruba"
"[78][79] After the incident, Seigenthaler described Wikipedia as ""a flawed and irresponsible research tool"".","Not Yoruba"
"[77] This incident led to policy changes at Wikipedia, specifically targeted at tightening up the verifiability of biographical articles of living people.","Not Yoruba"
"[80] In 2010, Daniel Tosh encouraged viewers of his show, Tosh.0, to visit the show's Wikipedia article and edit it at will.","Not Yoruba"
"On a later episode, he commented on the edits to the article, most of them offensive, which had been made by the audience and had prompted the article to be locked from editing.","Not Yoruba"
"[81][82] Wikipedians often have disputes regarding content, which may result in repeatedly making opposite changes to an article, known as ""edit warring"".","Not Yoruba"
"[83][84] The process is widely seen as a resource-consuming scenario where no useful knowledge is added.","Not Yoruba"
"[85] This practice is also criticized as creating a competitive,[86] conflict based[87] editing culture associated with traditional masculine gender roles,[88] which contributes to the gender bias on Wikipedia.","Not Yoruba"
"Special interest groups have engaged in edit wars to advance their own political interests.","Not Yoruba"
"Content in Wikipedia is subject to the laws (in particular, copyright laws) of the United States and of the US state of Virginia, where the majority of Wikipedia's servers are located.","Not Yoruba"
"Beyond legal matters, the editorial principles of Wikipedia are embodied in the ""five pillars"" and in numerous policies and guidelines intended to appropriately shape content.","Not Yoruba"
"Even these rules are stored in wiki form, and Wikipedia editors write and revise the website's policies and guidelines.","Not Yoruba"
"[89] Editors can enforce these rules by deleting or modifying non-compliant material.","Not Yoruba"
"Originally, rules on the non-English editions of Wikipedia were based on a translation of the rules for the English Wikipedia.","Not Yoruba"
"They have since diverged to some extent.","Not Yoruba"
"[67] According to the rules on the English Wikipedia, each entry in Wikipedia must be about a topic that is encyclopedic and is not a dictionary entry or dictionary-style.","Not Yoruba"
"[90] A topic should also meet Wikipedia's standards of ""notability"",[91] which generally means that the topic must have been covered in mainstream media or major academic journal sources that are independent of the article's subject.","Not Yoruba"
"Further, Wikipedia intends to convey only knowledge that is already established and recognized.","Not Yoruba"
"[92] It must not present original research.","Not Yoruba"
"A claim that is likely to be challenged requires a reference to a reliable source.","Not Yoruba"
"Among Wikipedia editors, this is often phrased as ""verifiability, not truth"" to express the idea that the readers, not the encyclopedia, are ultimately responsible for checking the truthfulness of the articles and making their own interpretations.","Not Yoruba"
"[93] This can at times lead to the removal of information that, though valid, is not properly sourced.","Not Yoruba"
"[94] Finally, Wikipedia must not take sides.","Not Yoruba"
"[95] All opinions and viewpoints, if attributable to external sources, must enjoy an appropriate share of coverage within an article.","Not Yoruba"
"This is known as a neutral point of view (NPOV).","Not Yoruba"

"[98] Editors in good standing in the community can run for one of many levels of volunteer stewardship: this begins with ""administrator"",[99][100] privileged users who can delete pages, prevent articles from being changed in case of vandalism or editorial disputes (setting protective measures on articles), and try to prevent certain people from editing.","Not Yoruba"
"Despite the name, administrators are not supposed to enjoy any special privilege in decision-making; instead, their powers are mostly limited to making edits that have project-wide effects and thus are disallowed to ordinary editors, and to implement restrictions intended to prevent certain persons from making disruptive edits (such as vandalism).","Not Yoruba"
"[101][102] Fewer editors become administrators than in years past, in part because the process of vetting potential Wikipedia administrators has become more rigorous.","Not Yoruba"
"[103] Bureaucrats name new administrators solely upon the recommendations from the community.","Not Yoruba"
"Over time, Wikipedia has developed a semi-formal dispute resolution process to assist in such circumstances.","Not Yoruba"

"The Arbitration Committee presides over the ultimate dispute resolution process.","Not Yoruba"
"Although disputes usually arise from a disagreement between two opposing views on how an article should read, the Arbitration Committee explicitly refuses to directly rule on the specific view that should be adopted.","Not Yoruba"
"Statistical analyses suggest that the committee ignores the content of disputes and rather focuses on the way disputes are conducted,[104] functioning not so much to resolve disputes and make peace between conflicting editors, but to weed out problematic editors while allowing potentially productive editors back in to participate.","Not Yoruba"
"Therefore, the committee does not dictate the content of articles, although it sometimes condemns content changes when it deems the new content violates Wikipedia policies (for example, if the new content is considered biased).","Not Yoruba"
"Its remedies include cautions and probations (used in 63% of cases) and banning editors from articles (43%), subject matters (23%), or Wikipedia (16%).","Not Yoruba"
"Complete bans from Wikipedia are generally limited to instances of impersonation and anti-social behavior.","Not Yoruba"
"When conduct is not impersonation or anti-social, but rather anti-consensus or in violation of editing policies, remedies tend to be limited to warnings.","Not Yoruba"

"[137] Though each language edition functions more or less independently, some efforts are made to supervise them all.","Not Yoruba"
"They are coordinated in part by Meta-Wiki, the Wikimedia Foundation's wiki devoted to maintaining all its projects (Wikipedia and others).","Not Yoruba"
"[138] For instance, Meta-Wiki provides important statistics on all language editions of Wikipedia,[139] and it maintains a list of articles every Wikipedia should have.","Not Yoruba"
"[140] The list concerns basic content by subject: biography, history, geography, society, culture, science, technology, and mathematics.","Not Yoruba"
"It is not rare for articles strongly related to a particular language not to have counterparts in another edition.","Not Yoruba"
"For example, articles about small towns in the United States might be available only in English, even when they meet the notability criteria of other language Wikipedia projects.","Not Yoruba"
"Translated articles represent only a small portion of articles in most editions, in part because those editions do not allow fully automated translation of articles.","Not Yoruba"

"The first of these was the 1986 BBC Domesday Project, which included text (entered on BBC Micro computers) and photographs from more than a million contributors in the UK, and covered the geography, art, and culture of the UK.","Not Yoruba"
"This was the first interactive multimedia encyclopedia (and was also the first major multimedia document connected through internal links), with the majority of articles being accessible through an interactive map of the UK.","Not Yoruba"
"The user interface and part of the content of the Domesday Project were emulated on a website until 2008.","Not Yoruba"
"[362] Several free-content, collaborative encyclopedias were created around the same period as Wikipedia (e.g.","Not Yoruba"

"[364] One of the most successful early online encyclopedias incorporating entries by the public was h2g2, which was created by Douglas Adams in 1999.","Not Yoruba"
"The h2g2 encyclopedia is relatively lighthearted, focusing on articles which are both witty and informative.","Not Yoruba"
"Subsequent collaborative knowledge websites have drawn inspiration from Wikipedia.","Not Yoruba"
"Some, such as Susning.nu, Enciclopedia Libre, Hudong, and Baidu Baike likewise employ no formal review process, although some like Conservapedia are not as open.","Not Yoruba"

"[365][366] Machine learning (ML) is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience.","Not Yoruba"
"[1] It is seen as a part of artificial intelligence.","Not Yoruba"
"Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as ""training data"", in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so.","Not Yoruba"
"[2] Machine learning algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications, such as email filtering and computer vision, where it is difficult or unfeasible to develop conventional algorithms to perform the needed tasks.","Not Yoruba"
"A subset of machine learning is closely related to computational statistics, which focuses on making predictions using computers; but not all machine learning is statistical learning.","Not Yoruba"
"The study of mathematical optimization delivers methods, theory and application domains to the field of machine learning.","Not Yoruba"
"Data mining is a related field of study, focusing on exploratory data analysis through unsupervised learning.","Not Yoruba"
"[4][5] In its application across business problems, machine learning is also referred to as predictive analytics.","Not Yoruba"
"Machine learning involves computers discovering how they can perform tasks without being explicitly programmed to do so.","Not Yoruba"
"It involves computers learning from data provided so that they carry out certain tasks.","Not Yoruba"
"For simple tasks assigned to computers, it is possible to program algorithms telling the machine how to execute all steps required to solve the problem at hand; on the computer's part, no learning is needed.","Not Yoruba"
"For more advanced tasks, it can be challenging for a human to manually create the needed algorithms.","Not Yoruba"
"In practice, it can turn out to be more effective to help the machine develop its own algorithm, rather than having human programmers specify every needed step.","Not Yoruba"
"[6] The discipline of machine learning employs various approaches to teach computers to accomplish tasks where no fully satisfactory algorithm is available.","Not Yoruba"
"In cases where vast numbers of potential answers exist, one approach is to label some of the correct answers as valid.","Not Yoruba"
"This can then be used as training data for the computer to improve the algorithm(s) it uses to determine correct answers.","Not Yoruba"
"For example, to train a system for the task of digital character recognition, the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits has often been used.","Not Yoruba"
"[6] Machine learning approaches are traditionally divided into three broad categories, depending on the nature of the ""signal"" or ""feedback"" available to the learning system: Other approaches have been developed which don't fit neatly into this three-fold categorisation, and sometimes more than one is used by the same machine learning system.","Not Yoruba"
"For example topic modeling, dimensionality reduction or meta learning.","Not Yoruba"
"[7] As of 2020, deep learning has become the dominant approach for much ongoing work in the field of machine learning.","Not Yoruba"
"[6] The term machine learning was coined in 1959 by Arthur Samuel, an American IBMer and pioneer in the field of computer gaming and artificial intelligence.","Not Yoruba"
"[8][9] A representative book of the machine learning research during the 1960s was the Nilsson's book on Learning Machines, dealing mostly with machine learning for pattern classification.","Not Yoruba"
"[10] Interest related to pattern recognition continued into the 1970s, as described by Duda and Hart in 1973.","Not Yoruba"
"[11] In 1981 a report was given on using teaching strategies so that a neural network learns to recognize 40 characters (26 letters, 10 digits, and 4 special symbols) from a computer terminal.","Not Yoruba"
"[12] Tom M. Mitchell provided a widely quoted, more formal definition of the algorithms studied in the machine learning field: ""A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P,  improves with experience E.""[13] This definition of the tasks in which machine learning is concerned offers a fundamentally operational definition rather than defining the field in cognitive terms.","Not Yoruba"
"This follows Alan Turing's proposal in his paper ""Computing Machinery and Intelligence"", in which the question ""Can machines think?""","Not Yoruba"
"is replaced with the question ""Can machines do what we (as thinking entities) can do?"".","Not Yoruba"
"[14] Modern day machine learning has two objectives, one is to classify data based on models which have been developed, the other purpose is to make predictions for future outcomes based on these models.","Not Yoruba"
"A hypothetical algorithm specific to classifying data may use computer vision of moles coupled with supervised learning in order to train it to classify the cancerous moles.","Not Yoruba"
"Where as, a machine learning algorithm for stock trading may inform the trader of future potential predictions.","Not Yoruba"
"[15] As a scientific endeavor, machine learning grew out of the quest for artificial intelligence.","Not Yoruba"
"In the early days of AI as an academic discipline, some researchers were interested in having machines learn from data.","Not Yoruba"
"They attempted to approach the problem with various symbolic methods, as well as what was then termed ""neural networks""; these were mostly perceptrons and other models that were later found to be reinventions of the generalized linear models of statistics.","Not Yoruba"
"[18] Probabilistic reasoning was also employed, especially in automated medical diagnosis.","Not Yoruba"
"[19]:488 However, an increasing emphasis on the logical, knowledge-based approach caused a rift between AI and machine learning.","Not Yoruba"
"Probabilistic systems were plagued by theoretical and practical problems of data acquisition and representation.","Not Yoruba"
"[19]:488 By 1980, expert systems had come to dominate AI, and statistics was out of favor.","Not Yoruba"
"[20] Work on symbolic/knowledge-based learning did continue within AI, leading to inductive logic programming, but the more statistical line of research was now outside the field of AI proper, in pattern recognition and information retrieval.","Not Yoruba"
"[19]:708–710; 755 Neural networks research had been abandoned by AI and computer science around the same time.","Not Yoruba"
"This line, too, was continued outside the AI/CS field, as ""connectionism"", by researchers from other disciplines including Hopfield, Rumelhart and Hinton.","Not Yoruba"
"Their main success came in the mid-1980s with the reinvention of backpropagation.","Not Yoruba"
"[19]:25 Machine learning (ML), reorganized as a separate field, started to flourish in the 1990s.","Not Yoruba"
"The field changed its goal from achieving artificial intelligence to tackling solvable problems of a practical nature.","Not Yoruba"
"It shifted focus away from the symbolic approaches it had inherited from AI, and toward methods and models borrowed from statistics and probability theory.","Not Yoruba"
"[20] As of 2020, many sources continue to assert that machine learning remains a subfield of AI.","Not Yoruba"
"[21][22][16] The main disagreement is whether all of ML is part of AI, as this would mean that anyone using ML could claim they are using AI.","Not Yoruba"
"Others have the view that not all of ML is part of AI[23][24][25] where only an 'intelligent' subset of ML is part of AI.","Not Yoruba"
"[26] The question to what is the difference between ML and AI is answered by Judea Pearl in The Book of Why.","Not Yoruba"
"[27] Accordingly ML learns and predicts based on passive observations, whereas AI implies an agent  interacting with the environment to learn and take actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals.","Not Yoruba"
"[30] Machine learning and data mining often employ the same methods and overlap significantly, but while machine learning focuses on prediction, based on known properties learned from the training data, data mining focuses on the discovery of (previously) unknown properties in the data (this is the analysis step of knowledge discovery in databases).","Not Yoruba"
"Data mining uses many machine learning methods, but with different goals; on the other hand, machine learning also employs data mining methods as ""unsupervised learning"" or as a preprocessing step to improve learner accuracy.","Not Yoruba"
"Much of the confusion between these two research communities (which do often have separate conferences and separate journals, ECML PKDD being a major exception) comes from the basic assumptions they work with: in machine learning, performance is usually evaluated with respect to the ability to reproduce known knowledge, while in knowledge discovery and data mining (KDD) the key task is the discovery of previously unknown knowledge.","Not Yoruba"
"Evaluated with respect to known knowledge, an uninformed (unsupervised) method will easily be outperformed by other supervised methods, while in a typical KDD task, supervised methods cannot be used due to the unavailability of training data.","Not Yoruba"
"Machine learning also has intimate ties to optimization: many learning problems are formulated as minimization of some loss function on a training set of examples.","Not Yoruba"
"Loss functions express the discrepancy between the predictions of the model being trained and the actual problem instances (for example, in classification, one wants to assign a label to instances, and models are trained to correctly predict the pre-assigned labels of a set of examples).","Not Yoruba"
"[31] The difference between optimization and machine learning arises from the goal of generalization: while optimization algorithms can minimize the loss on a training set, machine learning is concerned with minimizing the loss on unseen samples.","Not Yoruba"
"Characterizing the generalization of various learning algorithms is an active topic of current research, especially for deep learning algorithms.","Not Yoruba"
"Machine learning and statistics are closely related fields in terms of methods, but distinct in their principal goal: statistics draws population inferences from a sample, while machine learning finds generalizable predictive patterns.","Not Yoruba"
"[32] According to Michael I. Jordan, the ideas of machine learning, from methodological principles to theoretical tools, have had a long pre-history in statistics.","Not Yoruba"
"[33] He also suggested the term data science as a placeholder to call the overall field.","Not Yoruba"
"[33] Leo Breiman distinguished two statistical modeling paradigms: data model and algorithmic model,[34] wherein ""algorithmic model"" means more or less the machine learning algorithms like Random forest.","Not Yoruba"
"Some statisticians have adopted methods from machine learning, leading to a combined field that they call statistical learning.","Not Yoruba"
"[35] A core objective of a learner is to generalize from its experience.","Not Yoruba"
"[3][36] Generalization in this context is the ability of a learning machine to perform accurately on new, unseen examples/tasks after having experienced a learning data set.","Not Yoruba"
"The training examples come from some generally unknown probability distribution (considered representative of the space of occurrences) and the learner has to build a general model about this space that enables it to produce sufficiently accurate predictions in new cases.","Not Yoruba"
"The computational analysis of machine learning algorithms and their performance is a branch of theoretical computer science known as computational learning theory.","Not Yoruba"
"Because training sets are finite and the future is uncertain, learning theory usually does not yield guarantees of the performance of algorithms.","Not Yoruba"
"Instead, probabilistic bounds on the performance are quite common.","Not Yoruba"
"The bias–variance decomposition is one way to quantify generalization error.","Not Yoruba"
"For the best performance in the context of generalization, the complexity of the hypothesis should match the complexity of the function underlying the data.","Not Yoruba"
"If the hypothesis is less complex than the function, then the model has under fitted the data.","Not Yoruba"
"If the complexity of the model is increased in response, then the training error decreases.","Not Yoruba"
"But if the hypothesis is too complex, then the model is subject to overfitting and generalization will be poorer.","Not Yoruba"
"[37] In addition to performance bounds, learning theorists study the time complexity and feasibility of learning.","Not Yoruba"
"In computational learning theory, a computation is considered feasible if it can be done in polynomial time.","Not Yoruba"
"There are two kinds of time complexity results.","Not Yoruba"
"Positive results show that a certain class of functions can be learned in polynomial time.","Not Yoruba"
"Negative results show that certain classes cannot be learned in polynomial time.","Not Yoruba"
"The types of machine learning algorithms differ in their approach, the type of data they input and output, and the type of task or problem that they are intended to solve.","Not Yoruba"
"Supervised learning algorithms build a mathematical model of a set of data that contains both the inputs and the desired outputs.","Not Yoruba"
"[38] The data is known as training data, and consists of a set of training examples.","Not Yoruba"
"Each training example has one or more inputs and the desired output, also known as a supervisory signal.","Not Yoruba"
"In the mathematical model, each training example is represented by an array or vector, sometimes called a feature vector, and the training data is represented by a matrix.","Not Yoruba"
"Through iterative optimization of an objective function, supervised learning algorithms learn a function that can be used to predict the output associated with new inputs.","Not Yoruba"
"[39] An optimal function will allow the algorithm to correctly determine the output for inputs that were not a part of the training data.","Not Yoruba"
"An algorithm that improves the accuracy of its outputs or predictions over time is said to have learned to perform that task.","Not Yoruba"
"[13] Types of supervised learning algorithms include active learning, classification and regression.","Not Yoruba"
"[40] Classification algorithms are used when the outputs are restricted to a limited set of values, and regression algorithms are used when the outputs may have any numerical value within a range.","Not Yoruba"
"As an example, for a classification algorithm that filters emails, the input would be an incoming email, and the output would be the name of the folder in which to file the email.","Not Yoruba"
"Similarity learning is an area of supervised machine learning closely related to regression and classification, but the goal is to learn from examples using a similarity function that measures how similar or related two objects are.","Not Yoruba"
"It has applications in ranking, recommendation systems, visual identity tracking, face verification, and speaker verification.","Not Yoruba"
"Unsupervised learning algorithms take a set of data that contains only inputs, and find structure in the data, like grouping or clustering of data points.","Not Yoruba"
"The algorithms, therefore, learn from test data that has not been labeled, classified or categorized.","Not Yoruba"
"Instead of responding to feedback, unsupervised learning algorithms identify commonalities in the data and react based on the presence or absence of such commonalities in each new piece of data.","Not Yoruba"
"A central application of unsupervised learning is in the field of density estimation in statistics, such as finding the probability density function.","Not Yoruba"
"[41] Though unsupervised learning encompasses other domains involving summarizing and explaining data features.","Not Yoruba"
"Cluster analysis is the assignment of a set of observations into subsets (called clusters) so that observations within the same cluster are similar according to one or more predesignated criteria, while observations drawn from different clusters are dissimilar.","Not Yoruba"
"Different clustering techniques make different assumptions on the structure of the data, often defined by some similarity metric and evaluated, for example, by internal compactness, or the similarity between members of the same cluster, and separation, the difference between clusters.","Not Yoruba"
"Other methods are based on estimated density and graph connectivity.","Not Yoruba"
"Semi-supervised learning falls between unsupervised learning (without any labeled training data) and supervised learning (with completely labeled training data).","Not Yoruba"
"Some of the training examples are missing training labels,  yet many machine-learning researchers have found that unlabeled data, when used in conjunction with a small amount of labeled data, can produce a considerable improvement in learning accuracy.","Not Yoruba"
"In weakly supervised learning, the training labels are noisy, limited, or imprecise; however, these labels are often cheaper to obtain, resulting in larger effective training sets.","Not Yoruba"
"[42] Reinforcement learning is an area of machine learning concerned with how software agents ought to take actions in an environment so as to maximize some notion of cumulative reward.","Not Yoruba"
"Due to its generality, the field is studied in many other disciplines, such as game theory, control theory, operations research, information theory, simulation-based optimization, multi-agent systems, swarm intelligence, statistics and genetic algorithms.","Not Yoruba"
"In machine learning, the environment is typically represented as a Markov decision process (MDP).","Not Yoruba"
"Many reinforcement learning algorithms use dynamic programming techniques.","Not Yoruba"
"[43] Reinforcement learning algorithms do not assume knowledge of an exact mathematical model of the MDP, and are used when exact models are infeasible.","Not Yoruba"
"Reinforcement learning algorithms are used in autonomous vehicles or in learning to play a game against a human opponent.","Not Yoruba"
"Self-learning as a machine learning paradigm was introduced in 1982 along with a neural network capable of self-learning named crossbar adaptive array (CAA).","Not Yoruba"
"[44] It is a learning with no external rewards and no external teacher advice.","Not Yoruba"
"The CAA self-learning algorithm computes, in a crossbar fashion, both decisions about actions and emotions (feelings) about consequence situations.","Not Yoruba"
"The system is driven by the interaction between cognition and emotion.","Not Yoruba"
"[45]
The self-learning algorithm updates a memory matrix W =||w(a,s)|| such that in each iteration executes the following machine learning routine: It is a system with only one input, situation s, and only one output, action (or behavior) a.","Not Yoruba"
"There is neither a separate reinforcement input nor an advice input from the environment.","Not Yoruba"
"The backpropagated value (secondary reinforcement) is the emotion toward the consequence situation.","Not Yoruba"
"The CAA exists in two environments, one is the behavioral environment where it behaves, and the other is the genetic environment, wherefrom it initially and only once receives initial emotions about situations to be encountered in the behavioral environment.","Not Yoruba"
"After receiving the genome (species) vector from the genetic environment, the CAA learns a goal-seeking behavior, in an environment that contains both desirable and undesirable situations.","Not Yoruba"
"[46] Several learning algorithms aim at discovering better representations of the inputs provided during training.","Not Yoruba"
"[47] Classic examples include principal components analysis and cluster analysis.","Not Yoruba"
"Feature learning algorithms, also called representation learning algorithms, often attempt to preserve the information in their input but also transform it in a way that makes it useful, often as a pre-processing step before performing classification or predictions.","Not Yoruba"
"This technique allows reconstruction of the inputs coming from the unknown data-generating distribution, while not being necessarily faithful to configurations that are implausible under that distribution.","Not Yoruba"
"This replaces manual feature engineering, and allows a machine to both learn the features and use them to perform a specific task.","Not Yoruba"
"Feature learning can be either supervised or unsupervised.","Not Yoruba"
"In supervised feature learning, features are learned using labeled input data.","Not Yoruba"
"Examples include artificial neural networks, multilayer perceptrons, and supervised dictionary learning.","Not Yoruba"
"In unsupervised feature learning, features are learned with unlabeled input data.","Not Yoruba"
"Examples include dictionary learning, independent component analysis, autoencoders, matrix factorization[48] and various forms of clustering.","Not Yoruba"
"[49][50][51] Manifold learning algorithms attempt to do so under the constraint that the learned representation is low-dimensional.","Not Yoruba"
"Sparse coding algorithms attempt to do so under the constraint that the learned representation is sparse, meaning that the mathematical model has many zeros.","Not Yoruba"
"Multilinear subspace learning algorithms aim to learn low-dimensional representations directly from tensor representations for multidimensional data, without reshaping them into higher-dimensional vectors.","Not Yoruba"
"[52] Deep learning algorithms discover multiple levels of representation, or a hierarchy of features, with higher-level, more abstract features defined in terms of (or generating) lower-level features.","Not Yoruba"
"It has been argued that an intelligent machine is one that learns a representation that disentangles the underlying factors of variation that explain the observed data.","Not Yoruba"
"[53] Feature learning is motivated by the fact that machine learning tasks such as classification often require input that is mathematically and computationally convenient to process.","Not Yoruba"
"However, real-world data such as images, video, and sensory data has not yielded to attempts to algorithmically define specific features.","Not Yoruba"
"An alternative is to discover such features or representations thorough examination, without relying on explicit algorithms.","Not Yoruba"
"Sparse dictionary learning is a feature learning method where a training example is represented as a linear combination of basis functions, and is assumed to be a sparse matrix.","Not Yoruba"
"The method is strongly NP-hard and difficult to solve approximately.","Not Yoruba"
"[54] A popular heuristic method for sparse dictionary learning is the K-SVD algorithm.","Not Yoruba"
"Sparse dictionary learning has been applied in several contexts.","Not Yoruba"
"In classification, the problem is to determine the class to which a previously unseen training example belongs.","Not Yoruba"
"For a dictionary where each class has already been built, a new training example is associated with the class that is best sparsely represented by the corresponding dictionary.","Not Yoruba"
"Sparse dictionary learning has also been applied in image de-noising.","Not Yoruba"
"The key idea is that a clean image patch can be sparsely represented by an image dictionary, but the noise cannot.","Not Yoruba"
"[55] In data mining, anomaly detection, also known as outlier detection, is the identification of rare items, events or observations which raise suspicions by differing significantly from the majority of the data.","Not Yoruba"
"[56] Typically, the anomalous items represent an issue such as bank fraud, a structural defect, medical problems or errors in a text.","Not Yoruba"
"Anomalies are referred to as outliers, novelties, noise, deviations and exceptions.","Not Yoruba"
"[57] In particular, in the context of abuse and network intrusion detection, the interesting objects are often not rare objects, but unexpected bursts of inactivity.","Not Yoruba"
"This pattern does not adhere to the common statistical definition of an outlier as a rare object, and many outlier detection methods (in particular, unsupervised algorithms) will fail on such data unless it has been aggregated appropriately.","Not Yoruba"
"Instead, a cluster analysis algorithm may be able to detect the micro-clusters formed by these patterns.","Not Yoruba"
"[58] Three broad categories of anomaly detection techniques exist.","Not Yoruba"
"[59] Unsupervised anomaly detection techniques detect anomalies in an unlabeled test data set under the assumption that the majority of the instances in the data set are normal, by looking for instances that seem to fit least to the remainder of the data set.","Not Yoruba"
"Supervised anomaly detection techniques require a data set that has been labeled as ""normal"" and ""abnormal"" and involves training a classifier (the key difference to many other statistical classification problems is the inherently unbalanced nature of outlier detection).","Not Yoruba"
"Semi-supervised anomaly detection techniques construct a model representing normal behavior from a given normal training data set and then test the likelihood of a test instance to be generated by the model.","Not Yoruba"
"In developmental robotics, robot learning algorithms generate their own sequences of learning experiences, also known as a curriculum, to cumulatively acquire new skills through self-guided exploration and social interaction with humans.","Not Yoruba"
"These robots use guidance mechanisms such as active learning, maturation, motor synergies and imitation.","Not Yoruba"
"Association rule learning is a rule-based machine learning method for discovering relationships between variables in large databases.","Not Yoruba"
"It is intended to identify strong rules discovered in databases using some measure of ""interestingness"".","Not Yoruba"
"[60] Rule-based machine learning is a general term for any machine learning method that identifies, learns, or evolves ""rules"" to store, manipulate or apply knowledge.","Not Yoruba"
"The defining characteristic of a rule-based machine learning algorithm is the identification and utilization of a set of relational rules that collectively represent the knowledge captured by the system.","Not Yoruba"
"This is in contrast to other machine learning algorithms that commonly identify a singular model that can be universally applied to any instance in order to make a prediction.","Not Yoruba"
"[61] Rule-based machine learning approaches include learning classifier systems, association rule learning, and artificial immune systems.","Not Yoruba"
"Based on the concept of strong rules, Rakesh Agrawal, Tomasz Imieliński and Arun Swami introduced association rules for discovering regularities between products in large-scale transaction data recorded by point-of-sale (POS) systems in supermarkets.","Not Yoruba"
"[62] For example, the rule

"Such information can be used as the basis for decisions about marketing activities such as promotional pricing or product placements.","Not Yoruba"
"In addition to market basket analysis, association rules are employed today in application areas including Web usage mining, intrusion detection, continuous production, and bioinformatics.","Not Yoruba"
"In contrast with sequence mining, association rule learning typically does not consider the order of items either within a transaction or across transactions.","Not Yoruba"
"Learning classifier systems (LCS) are a family of rule-based machine learning algorithms that combine a discovery component, typically a genetic algorithm, with a learning component, performing either supervised learning, reinforcement learning, or unsupervised learning.","Not Yoruba"
"They seek to identify a set of context-dependent rules that collectively store and apply knowledge in a piecewise manner in order to make predictions.","Not Yoruba"
"[63] Inductive logic programming (ILP) is an approach to rule-learning using logic programming as a uniform representation for input examples, background knowledge, and hypotheses.","Not Yoruba"
"Given an encoding of the known background knowledge and a set of examples represented as a logical database of facts, an ILP system will derive a hypothesized logic program that entails all positive and no negative examples.","Not Yoruba"
"Inductive programming is a related field that considers any kind of programming language for representing hypotheses (and not only logic programming), such as functional programs.","Not Yoruba"
"Inductive logic programming is particularly useful in bioinformatics and natural language processing.","Not Yoruba"
"Gordon Plotkin and Ehud Shapiro laid the initial theoretical foundation for inductive machine learning in a logical setting.","Not Yoruba"
"[64][65][66] Shapiro built their first implementation (Model Inference System) in 1981: a Prolog program that inductively inferred logic programs from positive and negative examples.","Not Yoruba"
"[67] The term inductive here refers to philosophical induction, suggesting a theory to explain observed facts, rather than mathematical induction, proving a property for all members of a well-ordered set.","Not Yoruba"
"Performing machine learning involves creating a model, which is trained on some training data and then can process additional data to make predictions.","Not Yoruba"
"Various types of models have been used and researched for machine learning systems.","Not Yoruba"
"Artificial neural networks (ANNs), or connectionist systems, are computing systems vaguely inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains.","Not Yoruba"
"Such systems ""learn"" to perform tasks by considering examples, generally without being programmed with any task-specific rules.","Not Yoruba"
"An ANN is a model based on a collection of connected units or nodes called ""artificial neurons"", which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain.","Not Yoruba"
"Each connection, like the synapses in a biological brain, can transmit information, a ""signal"", from one artificial neuron to another.","Not Yoruba"
"An artificial neuron that receives a signal can process it and then signal additional artificial neurons connected to it.","Not Yoruba"
"In common ANN implementations, the signal at a connection between artificial neurons is a real number, and the output of each artificial neuron is computed by some non-linear function of the sum of its inputs.","Not Yoruba"
"The connections between artificial neurons are called ""edges"".","Not Yoruba"
"Artificial neurons and edges typically have a weight that adjusts as learning proceeds.","Not Yoruba"
"The weight increases or decreases the strength of the signal at a connection.","Not Yoruba"
"Artificial neurons may have a threshold such that the signal is only sent if the aggregate signal crosses that threshold.","Not Yoruba"
"Typically, artificial neurons are aggregated into layers.","Not Yoruba"
"Different layers may perform different kinds of transformations on their inputs.","Not Yoruba"
"Signals travel from the first layer (the input layer) to the last layer (the output layer), possibly after traversing the layers multiple times.","Not Yoruba"
"The original goal of the ANN approach was to solve problems in the same way that a human brain would.","Not Yoruba"
"However, over time, attention moved to performing specific tasks, leading to deviations from biology.","Not Yoruba"
"Artificial neural networks have been used on a variety of tasks, including computer vision, speech recognition, machine translation, social network filtering, playing board and video games and medical diagnosis.","Not Yoruba"
"Deep learning consists of multiple hidden layers in an artificial neural network.","Not Yoruba"
"This approach tries to model the way the human brain processes light and sound into vision and hearing.","Not Yoruba"
"Some successful applications of deep learning are computer vision and speech recognition.","Not Yoruba"
"[68] Decision tree learning uses a decision tree as a predictive model to go from observations about an item (represented in the branches) to conclusions about the item's target value (represented in the leaves).","Not Yoruba"
"It is one of the predictive modeling approaches used in statistics, data mining, and machine learning.","Not Yoruba"
"Tree models where the target variable can take a discrete set of values are called classification trees; in these tree structures, leaves represent class labels and branches represent conjunctions of features that lead to those class labels.","Not Yoruba"
"Decision trees where the target variable can take continuous values (typically real numbers) are called regression trees.","Not Yoruba"
"In decision analysis, a decision tree can be used to visually and explicitly represent decisions and decision making.","Not Yoruba"
"In data mining, a decision tree describes data, but the resulting classification tree can be an input for decision making.","Not Yoruba"
"Support vector machines (SVMs), also known as support vector networks, are a set of related supervised learning methods used for classification and regression.","Not Yoruba"
"Given a set of training examples, each marked as belonging to one of two categories, an SVM training algorithm builds a model that predicts whether a new example falls into one category or the other.","Not Yoruba"
"[69]  An SVM training algorithm is a non-probabilistic, binary, linear classifier, although methods such as Platt scaling exist to use SVM in a probabilistic classification setting.","Not Yoruba"
"In addition to performing linear classification, SVMs can efficiently perform a non-linear classification using what is called the kernel trick, implicitly mapping their inputs into high-dimensional feature spaces.","Not Yoruba"
"Regression analysis encompasses a large variety of statistical methods to estimate the relationship between input variables and their associated features.","Not Yoruba"
"Its most common form is linear regression, where a single line is drawn to best fit the given data according to a mathematical criterion such as ordinary least squares.","Not Yoruba"
"The latter is often extended by regularization (mathematics) methods to mitigate overfitting and bias, as in ridge regression.","Not Yoruba"
"When dealing with non-linear problems, go-to models include polynomial regression (for example, used for trendline fitting in Microsoft Excel[70]), logistic regression (often used in statistical classification) or even kernel regression, which introduces non-linearity by taking advantage of the kernel trick to implicitly map input variables to higher-dimensional space.","Not Yoruba"
"A Bayesian network, belief network, or directed acyclic graphical model is a probabilistic graphical model that represents a set of random variables and their conditional independence with a directed acyclic graph (DAG).","Not Yoruba"
"For example, a Bayesian network could represent the probabilistic relationships between diseases and symptoms.","Not Yoruba"
"Given symptoms, the network can be used to compute the probabilities of the presence of various diseases.","Not Yoruba"
"Efficient algorithms exist that perform inference and learning.","Not Yoruba"
"Bayesian networks that model sequences of variables, like speech signals or protein sequences, are called dynamic Bayesian networks.","Not Yoruba"
"Generalizations of Bayesian networks that can represent and solve decision problems under uncertainty are called influence diagrams.","Not Yoruba"
"A genetic algorithm (GA) is a search algorithm and heuristic technique that mimics the process of natural selection, using methods such as mutation and crossover to generate new genotypes in the hope of finding good solutions to a given problem.","Not Yoruba"
"In machine learning, genetic algorithms were used in the 1980s and 1990s.","Not Yoruba"
"[71][72] Conversely, machine learning techniques have been used to improve the performance of genetic and evolutionary algorithms.","Not Yoruba"
"[73] Usually, machine learning models require a lot of data in order for them to perform well.","Not Yoruba"
"Usually, when training a machine learning model, one needs to collect a large, representative sample of data from a training set.","Not Yoruba"
"Data from the training set can be as varied as a corpus of text, a collection of images, and data collected from individual users of a service.","Not Yoruba"
"Overfitting is something to watch out for when training a machine learning model.","Not Yoruba"
"Trained models derived from biased data can result in skewed or undesired predictions.","Not Yoruba"
"Algorithmic bias is a potential result from data not fully prepared for training.","Not Yoruba"
"Federated learning is an adapted form of distributed artificial intelligence to training machine learning models that decentralizes the training process, allowing for users' privacy to be maintained by not needing to send their data to a centralized server.","Not Yoruba"
"This also increases efficiency by decentralizing the training process to many devices.","Not Yoruba"
"For example, Gboard uses federated machine learning to train search query prediction models on users' mobile phones without having to send individual searches back to Google.","Not Yoruba"
"[74] There are many applications for machine learning, including: In 2006, the media-services provider Netflix held the first ""Netflix Prize"" competition to find a program to better predict user preferences and improve the accuracy of its existing Cinematch movie recommendation algorithm by at least 10%.","Not Yoruba"
"A joint team made up of researchers from AT&T Labs-Research in collaboration with the teams Big Chaos and Pragmatic Theory built an ensemble model to win the Grand Prize in 2009 for $1 million.","Not Yoruba"
"[76] Shortly after the prize was awarded, Netflix realized that viewers' ratings were not the best indicators of their viewing patterns (""everything is a recommendation"") and they changed their recommendation engine accordingly.","Not Yoruba"
"[77] In 2010 The Wall Street Journal wrote about the firm Rebellion Research and their use of machine learning to predict the financial crisis.","Not Yoruba"
"[78] In 2012, co-founder of Sun Microsystems, Vinod Khosla, predicted that 80% of medical doctors' jobs would be lost in the next two decades to automated machine learning medical diagnostic software.","Not Yoruba"
"[79] In 2014, it was reported that a machine learning algorithm had been applied in the field of art history to study fine art paintings and that it may have revealed previously unrecognized influences among artists.","Not Yoruba"
"[80] In 2019 Springer Nature published the first research book created using machine learning.","Not Yoruba"
"[81] Although machine learning has been transformative in some fields, machine-learning programs often fail to deliver expected results.","Not Yoruba"
"[82][83][84] Reasons for this are numerous: lack of (suitable) data, lack of access to the data, data bias, privacy problems, badly chosen tasks and algorithms, wrong tools and people, lack of resources, and evaluation problems.","Not Yoruba"
"[85] In 2018, a self-driving car from Uber failed to detect a pedestrian, who was killed after a collision.","Not Yoruba"
"[86] Attempts to use machine learning in healthcare with the IBM Watson system failed to deliver even after years of time and billions of dollars invested.","Not Yoruba"
"[87][88] Machine learning has been used as a strategy to update the evidence related to systematic review and increased reviewer burden related to the growth of biomedical literature.","Not Yoruba"
"While it has improved with training sets, it has not yet developed sufficiently to reduce the workload burden without limiting the necessary sensitivity for the findings research themselves.","Not Yoruba"
"[89] Machine learning approaches in particular can suffer from different data biases.","Not Yoruba"
"A machine learning system trained on current customers only may not be able to predict the needs of new customer groups that are not represented in the training data.","Not Yoruba"
"When trained on man-made data, machine learning is likely to pick up the same constitutional and unconscious biases already present in society.","Not Yoruba"
"[90] Language models learned from data have been shown to contain human-like biases.","Not Yoruba"
"[91][92] Machine learning systems used for criminal risk assessment have been found to be biased against black people.","Not Yoruba"
"[93][94] In 2015, Google photos would often tag black people as gorillas,[95] and in 2018 this still was not well resolved, but Google reportedly was still using the workaround to remove all gorillas from the training data, and thus was not able to recognize real gorillas at all.","Not Yoruba"
"[96] Similar issues with recognizing non-white people have been found in many other systems.","Not Yoruba"
"[97] In 2016, Microsoft tested a chatbot that learned from Twitter, and it quickly picked up racist and sexist language.","Not Yoruba"
"[98] Because of such challenges, the effective use of machine learning may take longer to be adopted in other domains.","Not Yoruba"
"[99] Concern for fairness in machine learning, that is, reducing bias in machine learning and propelling its use for human good is increasingly expressed by artificial intelligence scientists, including Fei-Fei Li, who reminds engineers that ""There’s nothing artificial about AI...It’s inspired by people, it’s created by people, and—most importantly—it impacts people.","Not Yoruba"
"It is a powerful tool we are only just beginning to understand, and that is a profound responsibility.”[100] Classification of machine learning models can be validated by accuracy estimation techniques like the holdout method, which splits the data in a training and test set (conventionally 2/3 training set and 1/3 test set designation) and evaluates the performance of the training model on the test set.","Not Yoruba"
"In comparison, the K-fold-cross-validation method randomly partitions the data into K subsets and then K experiments are performed each respectively considering 1 subset for evaluation and the remaining K-1 subsets for training the model.","Not Yoruba"
"In addition to the holdout and cross-validation methods, bootstrap, which samples n instances with replacement from the dataset, can be used to assess model accuracy.","Not Yoruba"
"[101] In addition to overall accuracy, investigators frequently report sensitivity and specificity meaning True Positive Rate (TPR) and True Negative Rate (TNR) respectively.","Not Yoruba"
"Similarly, investigators sometimes report the false positive rate (FPR) as well as the false negative rate (FNR).","Not Yoruba"
"However, these rates are ratios that fail to reveal their numerators and denominators.","Not Yoruba"
"The total operating characteristic (TOC) is an effective method to express a model's diagnostic ability.","Not Yoruba"
"TOC shows the numerators and denominators of the previously mentioned rates, thus TOC provides more information than the commonly used receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and ROC's associated area under the curve (AUC).","Not Yoruba"
"[102] Machine learning poses a host of ethical questions.","Not Yoruba"
"Systems which are trained on datasets collected with biases may exhibit these biases upon use (algorithmic bias), thus digitizing cultural prejudices.","Not Yoruba"
"[103] For example, using job hiring data from a firm with racist hiring policies may lead to a machine learning system duplicating the bias by scoring job applicants against similarity to previous successful applicants.","Not Yoruba"
"[104][105] Responsible collection of data and documentation of algorithmic rules used by a system thus is a critical part of machine learning.","Not Yoruba"
"The evolvement of AI systems raises a lot questions in the realm of ethics and morality.","Not Yoruba"
"AI can be well equipped in making decisions in certain fields such technical and scientific which rely
heavily on data and historical information.","Not Yoruba"
"These decisions rely on objectivity and logical reasoning.","Not Yoruba"
"[106] Because human languages contain biases, machines trained on language corpora will necessarily also learn these biases.","Not Yoruba"
"[107][108] Other forms of ethical challenges, not related to personal biases, are more seen in health care.","Not Yoruba"
"There are concerns among health care professionals that these systems might not be designed in the public's interest but as income-generating machines.","Not Yoruba"
"This is especially true in the United States where there is a long-standing ethical dilemma of improving health care, but also increasing profits.","Not Yoruba"
"For example, the algorithms could be designed to provide patients with unnecessary tests or medication in which the algorithm's proprietary owners hold stakes.","Not Yoruba"
"There is huge potential for machine learning in health care to provide professionals a great tool to diagnose, medicate, and even plan recovery paths for patients, but this will not happen until the personal biases mentioned previously, and these ""greed"" biases are addressed.","Not Yoruba"
"[109] Since the 2010s, advances in both machine learning algorithms and computer hardware have led to more efficient methods for training deep neural networks (a particular narrow subdomain of machine learning) that contain many layers of non-linear hidden units.","Not Yoruba"
"[110] By 2019, graphic processing units (GPUs), often with AI-specific enhancements, had displaced CPUs as the dominant method of training large-scale commercial cloud AI.","Not Yoruba"
"[111] OpenAI estimated the hardware compute used in the largest deep learning projects from AlexNet (2012) to AlphaZero (2017), and found a 300,000-fold increase in the amount of compute required, with a doubling-time trendline of 3.4 months.","Not Yoruba"

"Le mot nature est un terme polysémique (c’est-à-dire qu'il a plusieurs sens) : il peut signifier la composition et la matière d'une chose (ce qu'elle est, son essence), l'origine et le devenir d'une chose, l'ensemble du réel indépendant de la culture humaine, ou l'ensemble des systèmes et des phénomènes naturels[1].","French"
"Au sens commun, la nature peut regrouper : Face au constat des répercussions négatives des activités humaines sur l'environnement biophysique et la perte accélérée de naturalité et de biodiversité au cours des dernières décennies, la protection de la nature et des milieux naturels, la sauvegarde des habitats et des espèces, la mise en place d'un développement durable et raisonnable et l'éducation à l'environnement sont devenues des demandes pour une grande partie des citoyens de la plupart des pays industrialisés.","French"
"Les principes de l'éthique environnementale, de nouvelles lois et des chartes de protection de l'environnement fondent le développement d'une idéologie culturelle humaine en relation avec la biosphère.","French"
"Si l'étymologie du terme « nature » est relativement bien connue, l'évolution de son sens est beaucoup plus complexe à déterminer, et ce terme a connu des significations très différentes voire contradictoires pendant son histoire[1].","French"
"Le mot nature est attesté en français depuis 1119[2].","French"
"Il vient du latin natura, qui désignait « le cours des choses ; le caractère naturel, la constitution, la qualité ; l'univers » et littéralement « naissance ».","French"
"Le terme vient lui-même du verbe nascor (« naître »), ici au supin[1].","French"
"Si ce terme signifie essentiellement le « caractère inné » au IIe siècle avant notre ère, le latin classique, notamment par le biais de Cicéron, va l'enrichir de tous les sens du terme grec phusis, beaucoup plus complexe et obscur et dont il devient la traduction en philosophie latine[1].","French"
"Phusis vient du verbe phuein, dérivé de la racine phu qui désigne la croissance végétale.","French"
"Phuein, c'est l'éclosion, ce qui se manifeste en révélant ce qui était contenu dans la semence ; ainsi, le phuein, c'est le propre de la plante qui croît à partir de soi-même, qui a son centre de changement à l'intérieur et non pas à l'extérieur, comme une pierre.","French"
"Pour Merleau-Ponty, cette parenté de la phusis et du végétal fait que « est nature ce qui a un sens, sans que ce sens ait été posé par la pensée.","French"
"C'est l'autoproduction d'un sens »[3].","French"
"Cette étymologie indique que les anciens grecs et romains avaient une conception dynamique, « vitaliste » de la nature[1], conception selon laquelle le vivant n'est pas réductible aux lois physico-chimiques de la matière[4].","French"
"Pour les grecs de l'antiquité, Aristote en particulier, la nature est une puissance d'engendrement des êtres, mais cette puissance n'est pas séparée des choses elles-mêmes, elle leur est « immanente » : « chaque être naturel a en soi-même un principe de mouvement et de repos »[5].","French"
"Aristote énumère cependant plusieurs définitions différentes de la nature, et introduit une opposition entre le naturel et l'artificiel : le naturel est ce qui est produit par la phusis, ce qui existe par soi-même, l'artificiel est ce qui est produit par la technè, par l'action et le travail (d'Hommes, d'animaux ou de dieux).","French"
"C'est cette opposition qui sera plus tard reprise dans la philosophie romaine par Cicéron à travers l'opposition nature/culture[1].","French"
"Cette première approche dynamique et vitaliste s'est estompée au XVIIe siècle où le mot devient synonyme d'univers matériel, réglé par des lois[1].","French"
"C'est ainsi que Fontenelle, après Descartes, dira que « la nature est en grand ce qu'une montre est en petit »[6].","French"
"Mais si cette vision mécaniste de la nature reste encore largement répandue, elle a été critiquée par la génération romantique au début du XIXe siècle, et notamment par Engels dans son Anti-Dühring[7] : pour lui il faut concevoir la nature, aussi bien sur terre que dans l'univers comme un processus évolutif, historique et dialectique : rien dans la nature ne reste identique à soi, tout change et se transforme en permanence.","French"
"Cette nouvelle approche redevenue dynamique s'illustrera pendant tout le XIXe siècle, notamment à travers Darwin qui instaure, dans la foulée de Buffon, une approche historique de la nature, qui n'est dès lors plus fixe : les espèces évoluent en permanence, ainsi que les milieux dans lesquels elles vivent.","French"
"Tandis que Darwin se concentre sur l'histoire des êtres, celle des roches sera illustrée par Alfred Wegener, qui théorise la dérive des continents.","French"
"La première grande philosophie de la nature se trouve dans l'œuvre d'Aristote.","French"
"Selon lui, « la nature ne fait rien en  vain », ce qui signifie que la nature est une puissance orientée vers certaines  fins.","French"
"L'explication  scientifique consistera donc à découvrir cette finalité.","French"
"Par exemple, si l'eau monte dans un tuyau dont on aspire l'air, c'est parce que ""la nature a horreur du vide"".","French"
"Selon Jan Patocka, « On peut demander si cette philosophie ne nous offre pas un cas typique d'anthropomorphisme »[8].","French"
"En fait Aristote pense l'action de la nature à partir du travail de l'artisan qui imprime une forme à la matière pour arriver à son but qui est de créer un objet.","French"
"La différence est que le travail de l'artisan reste extérieur à la matière alors que la nature agit à l'intérieur de la matière :« chaque être naturel a en soi-même un principe de mouvement et de repos »[9].","French"
"Mais cette action de la nature est infiniment plus parfaite que celle de l'artisan et de sa ""techné"".« l'homme ne peut produire d'être vivant, ni d'être animé aussi parfait que les êtres de nature »[10].","French"
"C'est pourquoi Aristote affirme que « l'art imite la nature »[11] Cette conception finaliste de la nature a été contredite par la philosophie mecaniste développée au XVII°siècle par Descartes.","French"
"Selon Miguel Espinoza « le mécanisme est le squelette métaphysique de la science »[12].","French"
"Dans cette philosophie, la nature n'est plus vue comme une puissance orientée vers la perfection et que l'homme devrait imiter, mais comme un univers matériel soumis à des règles   (""les lois de la nature"").","French"
"Connaissant ces règles, l'homme peut alors se rendre « comme maître et possesseur de la nature » (Descartes).","French"
"Cependant, cette conception réduit la nature à un statut d'objet dont les êtres humains (les sujets) pourraient disposer à leur guise.","French"
"L'écologie contemporaine a montré les limites de ce dualisme.","French"
"Comme le dit Michel Serres nous devons modifier notre rapport à la nature : il propose dans son livre ""Le contrat naturel"" (1990) de considérer la nature comme ""un sujet de droit"" : « la nature serait ce sujet de droit avec lequel on passerait ce fameux contrat.","French"
"»[13] Dans la même perspective François Flahault montre que la séparation de l'homme et de la nature remonte au dualisme platonicien et chrétien qui séparent l'âme et le corps, et il propose de s'en affranchir en prenant conscience que l'homme fait intégralement partie de la nature.","French"
"Il nous faut « reconnaître à qui et à quoi nous devons la vie - et le verbe ""devoir"", ici, nous oriente vers la gratitude et le soin, nous invite à cultiver des relations d'affiliation, à assumer des responsabilités et des devoirs -.","French"
"» [14] Dans l'usage commun et religieux, la nature a longtemps été présentée dichotomiquement en Europe, comme ce qui est autour de l'Homme, qui n'est pas lui (opposé à la culture), et qui est animé par des processus ou des forces qui lui échappent[réf.","French"
"souhaitée] vu de façon horizontale, puis lors du Moyen Âge et avec l'arrivée de la pensée industrielle, une hiérarchie entre l'homme et la nature s'impose, l'homme est au-dessus de la nature, jusqu'à arriver à un stade d'opposition à la nature[15].","French"
"À présent, avec les progrès scientifiques, il est généralement considéré comme acquis que l'espèce humaine soit parmi d'autres dans la nature.","French"
"Les sciences et notamment l'écologie montrent que la nature (co-)évolue dans le temps et l'espace, selon des dynamiques complexes, incluant celles de l'évolution des espèces, la sélection naturelle, et que les forces animées ou détournées par l'être humain ou d'autres espèces sont devenues capables de modifier les grands processus naturels planétaires.","French"
"Dans l'interprétation des philosophies animistes ou religieuses, la nature est présentée comme manifestant l'équivalent d'une volonté autonome ou d'un sens déterminé.","French"
"Ainsi, celle-ci se vengera de ce qu'on lui fait de mal, ou au contraire rendra au centuple le bien qu'on lui fait.","French"
"Certains actes sont considérés comme contre nature.","French"
"Ces expressions laissent penser que des cultures de l'homme contemporain accordent une valeur particulière à la Nature, d'ordre éthique, d'ordre moral ou d'ordre naturel, qu'il s'y inclut ou non.","French"
"La nature est perçue par les sens et est pensée de façon variable selon les espèces et les individus inclus[réf.","French"
"souhaitée].","French"
"Du point de vue philosophique, la distinction se fait simplement entre la nature, la nature des espèces et la représentation de la nature humaine (Homo sapiens).","French"
"Le raisonnement confine, limite et précise donc par défaut la capacité humaine et l'envergure à accorder, à reconnaître et à considérer à la valeur de l'exercice.","French"
"La représentation de la « nature humaine » correspond logiquement aux philosophies humaines existantes et aux cultures humaines possibles.","French"
"La « philosophie de la nature » est un sujet d'apparence inexplorable par l'être vivant, malgré de multiples miroitements perceptibles.","French"
"D'une certaine façon, on peut dire que le christianisme, suivant la tradition biblique et judaïque, a désacralisé la nature, qui fut alors associée à celle d’une transcendance divine, extérieure à l'homme[1].","French"
"Le mot même de « nature » n'apparaît jamais dans la Bible[1].","French"
"Dans la Genèse, la nature est présentée dans le récit de la Création, comme l'œuvre d'un Dieu créateur : La Création se poursuit tout au long de « six jours ».","French"
"Le sixième jour, Dieu crée l'homme et la femme : La nature est alors présentée comme un accès à l’Écriture sainte.","French"
"Actuellement, pour les catholiques, la nature est l'appellation laïque de création.","French"
"Saint Augustin, reprenant la tradition philosophique grecque, voit dans les créatures deux types de nature : l'essence (essentia) et la substance (substantia).","French"
"Pour lui, « même le plus ignorant lit dans le monde ».","French"
"Les clés d'accès aux Écritures sont alors les quatre sens de l'Écriture.","French"
"La littérature allégorique du Moyen Âge faisait appel à plusieurs de ces sens pour l'interprétation des textes.","French"
"Alain de Lille (1114-1203) écrivit par exemple deux poèmes (Anticlaudianus et De planctu Naturae) dont le principal personnage est « Nature », qui est une figure emblématique des lois du monde créé par Dieu.","French"
"Il précise que ces poèmes doivent être lus à trois niveaux : au sens littéral (pour l'entendement puéril), au sens moral, ou au sens allégorique[16].","French"
"Une autre illustration de ces représentations de la nature se trouve dans la série des tapisseries de La Dame à la licorne, qui est toute chargée d'allégories[17].","French"
"L’idée sous-jacente est que la nature ne fait rien au hasard, mais est soumise à un commandement divin.","French"
"Le transcendantalisme, né au XIXe siècle, suit le principe selon lequel la nature est un être divin, apprenant à l'homme la raison et la beauté[1].","French"
"Les transcendantalistes trouvent dans la nature une source d'expériences et d'aventures indispensables au développement intellectuel et spirituel de l'Homme.","French"
"Cette idée prévaut jusqu’à l'apparition de la conception moderne de la science (Galilée).","French"
"Nouvelles représentations Avec Galilée et Descartes, une nouvelle représentation du monde apparaît avec une nouvelle hiérarchie.","French"
"Descartes rejette la philosophie scolastique : Dans sa philosophie, Descartes introduisit des rapports radicalement nouveaux entre  l'homme et la nature, divisant le monde entre « res extensa » (les choses, donc la nature, passive) et « res cogitans » (l'esprit, donc l'Homme et Dieu, actifs et pourvus d'une intentionnalité)[1].","French"
"Avec l’âge classique au XVIIe siècle, et la naissance de la science moderne, on assiste ainsi à l’invention d'une nouvelle représentation de la nature.","French"
"Cette représentation est le résultat de la croyance de beaucoup de philosophes des XVIIe et XVIIIe siècles, selon lesquels la nature était gouvernée par une loi universelle, la gravitation.","French"
"On perçoit une extension des limites du monde connu à d'autres planètes.","French"
"Le monde s'étend alors au système solaire dont on connaît les « lois » d'évolution qu'il est possible de décrire sous une forme mathématique.","French"
"La méthode expérimentale permit de faire progresser la connaissance de l’histoire « naturelle » (i.e.","French"
"des sciences naturelles).","French"
"Ce qui a fait dire à Maurice Merleau-Ponty « Ce ne sont pas les découvertes scientifiques qui ont provoqué le changement de l’idée de Nature.","French"
"C’est le changement de l’idée de Nature qui a permis ces découvertes »[19].","French"
"Émancipation de la pensée L'époque moderne a aussi inventé la liberté de pensée (cogito ergo sum, dit Descartes), il devient possible de parler publiquement d'athéisme.","French"
"L’intervention divine devient alors plus abstraite, confinée au mystère de la foi.","French"
"Ainsi, certaines formes d'empirisme ne rejettent pas la notion de foi et de religion, au contraire : la méthode expérimentale du physicien et chimiste irlandais Robert Boyle, par exemple, s'appuie sur une foi vécue dans l'expérimentation scientifique.","French"
"Descartes rejette la conception aristotélicienne de la nature, l'existence de Dieu étant perçue sur un plan purement métaphysique.","French"
"Une nouvelle conception de l’homme apparut au XVIIIe siècle, un homme qui s'appuie davantage sur la raison et sur l'expérience pour comprendre le monde.","French"
"Au XIXe siècle, la notion même de métaphysique s'estompe presque complètement, submergée par les idéologies.","French"
"Spinoza reviendra sur les propos de Descartes qu'il récuse notamment à travers son expression Deus sive Natura (« Dieu, c'est-à-dire la Nature »).","French"
"Spinoza, dans Le Traité théologico-politique et l'Éthique identifie Dieu à une Nature « nécessaire », divinité infinie et immanente qui fait un avec la nature.","French"
"La substance universelle se compose ainsi aussi bien du corps que de l'esprit.","French"
"La conception de l'homme, développée par Descartes, est tardive en Occident, mais également inédite dans l’histoire du monde.","French"
"Les sciences humaines n’héritent pas d’un domaine vacant car l’« homme n’existait pas ».","French"
"Mais cette émancipation partielle de l'humanité n'a pas pour autant supprimé toute forme de croyance.","French"
"Pendant les Lumières, alors que les pratiques religieuses sont souvent perçues comme des superstitions par les philosophes, la conception populaire d'une sacralisation de la nature prit une emphase toute particulière.","French"
"Ainsi, la croyance en un dieu créateur est très présente à travers le déisme : Voltaire ne croyait-il pas en un dieu créateur, qui aurait abandonné l'humanité à son triste destin ?","French"
"Cette croyance poussée à l'extrême engendra le culte de la Raison et de l'Être suprême.","French"
"Il est significatif de constater que dans ce contexte de déchristianisation, parmi les fêtes civiques, c'est la fête de la nature qui aura réellement du succès.","French"
"Évolutions sémantiques et esthétiques Ce changement de représentation se fit à la faveur d'un changement linguistique majeur : l'apparition du français classique[20].","French"
"Ainsi, le mot physique, qui étymologiquement, en grec, signifie la nature dans son ensemble (phusika), changea de sens pour prendre un sens presque exclusivement scientifique.","French"
"Un autre corollaire fut une évolution de la sensibilité esthétique.","French"
"La hiérarchie des genres de la peinture classique, par exemple, accordait peu d'importance au paysage.","French"
"Celui-ci occupa à partir du XIXe siècle une place beaucoup plus importante.","French"
"La conception cartésienne de la nature n'a pas pour autant supprimé le sens que donnent les naturalistes à ce mot.","French"
"L'histoire des sciences naturelles montre que l'interaction des êtres vivants entre eux et avec leur milieu a été une préoccupation constante de beaucoup de scientifiques, qui a pris une importance croissante jusqu'à l'avènement d'une écologie plus holistique, dont la naissance peut se situer vers le XVIIIe siècle.","French"
"Elle illustre la diversité des thèmes étudiés en écologie, et de façon plus générale dans les sciences naturelles.","French"
"Une étude de 2020[1] suggère qu'il existe actuellement quatre sens principaux au terme « nature », irréductibles les uns aux autres : La notion de nature porte donc en elle des questions philosophiques, à travers les rapports que l'homme entretient avec le milieu naturel et l'environnement, ses conceptions de la vie sociale, et les multiples sens qu'il est possible d'attribuer au mot nature dans les représentations sociales.","French"
"Le mot nature a donc conservé des sens multiples (polysémie).","French"
"Les préoccupations environnementales actuelles montrent combien il importe d'identifier ces sens et leurs finalités dans chaque contexte particulier : suivant la définition utilisée, le rapport de l'Humanité à la « nature » n'est pas le même, et l'idée de « conservation de la nature » change d'objet, d'objectifs et de méthodes[1].","French"
"La nature recouvre les réalités suivantes : La Terre est la seule planète connue pour abriter la vie et ses caractéristiques naturelles font l'objet de nombreuses recherches scientifiques.","French"
"Au sein du Système solaire, c'est la troisième la plus proche du Soleil ; c'est la plus grande planète tellurique et la cinquième plus grande de toutes.","French"
"Ses principales caractéristiques climatiques sont la présence de deux grandes régions polaires, deux zones tempérées relativement étroites et une vaste région équatoriale tropicale à subtropicale[21][réf.","French"
"à confirmer].","French"
"Les précipitations varient considérablement selon l'endroit, de plusieurs mètres d'eau par année à moins d'un millimètre[réf.","French"
"nécessaire].","French"
"71 % de la surface de la Terre est recouverte d'océans d'eau salée.","French"
"Le reste est constitué de continents et d'îles[réf.","French"
"nécessaire], la majeure partie des terres habitées se trouvant dans l'hémisphère Nord[pertinence contestée].","French"
"La Terre a évolué grâce à des processus géologiques et biologiques qui ont laissé des traces des conditions originales.","French"
"La surface extérieure est divisée en plusieurs plaques tectoniques qui migrent progressivement.","French"
"L'intérieur reste actif, avec une épaisse couche de manteau en convection et un noyau rempli de fer qui génère un champ magnétique.","French"
"Ce noyau de fer est composé d'une phase interne solide et d'une phase externe fluide.","French"
"Le mouvement de convection dans le noyau génère des courants électriques par dynamo qui, à leur tour, génèrent le champ géomagnétique[réf.","French"
"nécessaire].","French"
"Les conditions atmosphériques ont été considérablement modifiées par rapport aux conditions d'origine par la présence de formes de vie[22], ce qui crée un équilibre écologique qui stabilise les conditions de surface.","French"
"Malgré les grandes variations régionales du climat selon la latitude et d'autres facteurs géographiques, le climat mondial moyen à long terme est assez stable pendant les périodes interglaciaires[23], et les variations d'un degré ou deux de la température moyenne mondiale ont eu historiquement des effets majeurs sur l'équilibre écologique et sur la géographie de la Terre[24],[25].","French"
"Voir : Le caractère imprécis de la définition même de « Nature » entretient une ambiguïté dans la relation entre Hommes et Nature[1].","French"
"La biosphère terrestre étant de plus en plus marquée par l'empreinte de l'Homme, il devient de plus en plus difficile d'y trouver des espaces purement « naturels » au sens de « dépourvus d'influence humaine ».","French"
"La nature au sens le plus strict est refoulée d'une part vers le bas, dans le sous-sol lointain et les grands fonds océaniques, et d'autre part vers le haut, dans l'espace intersidéral.","French"
"Les phénomènes climatiques eux-mêmes ne sont plus considérés comme indépendants de l'activité humaine.","French"
"D'un autre côté, le concept est souvent employé dans un sens dérivé pour désigner des espaces aménagés par l'homme mais dans lesquels une large place est réservée à des peuplements végétaux et animaux ; c'est ainsi qu'on peut parler de nature à propos d'une forêt, même si elle est cultivée et exploitée depuis des siècles, et qu'on qualifie même de parcs naturels des territoires où s'exercent des activités agricoles intensives dotées de moyens mécaniques et chimiques modernes.","French"
"Dans ce cas, le qualificatif naturel désigne certaines caractéristiques paysagères (variables selon le lieu et sans définition universelle) et n'implique pas l'absence d'artifice humain.","French"
"Il fait référence à un mode de gestion de l'espace par l'Homme, plutôt qu'à une absence d'intervention humaine.","French"
"Le mot naturel a également été employé à l'époque coloniale dans un sens équivalent à celui du mot anglais native, c'est-à-dire au sens étymologique, pour désigner les habitants natifs des pays colonisés.","French"
"Cette appellation, qui ne se voulait pas injurieuse, avait cependant une connotation raciste dans la mesure où elle suggérait que ces hommes vivaient dans des conditions plus « proches de la nature » que les autres.","French"
"Dans le même ordre d'idées, l'imagination populaire représente souvent les hommes de la Préhistoire comme plus naturels que les hommes d'aujourd'hui, suggérant que la nature correspond à un état primitif dont le progrès amène inéluctablement à s'éloigner.","French"
"L'idée de nature a été remaniée par la culture urbaine à travers la notion mythique de sauvagerie désignant de manière générale ce qui est extérieur à la civilisation.","French"
"Le fait que le même mot sauvage soit utilisé d'une part comme un synonyme de naturel et d'autre part pour qualifier des actes particulièrement violents ou cruels (même s'ils sont commis dans des sociétés urbaines avec des moyens techniques sophistiqués) met bien en évidence une certaine tradition idéologique qui place plus ou moins consciemment du côté de la nature ce qui est étranger à la culture dominante et/ou mauvais.","French"
"Paradoxalement, il se trouve aussi que, dans d'autres contextes, le mot naturel est employé dans la langue populaire comme un synonyme de normal, légitime ou logique ; la Nature, lieu de la sauvagerie, est donc aussi celui du bon sens fondamental et, par voie de conséquence, elle est la source des principes les plus légitimes de l'Homme civilisé.","French"
"Le développement des sciences et des techniques au cours des deux derniers siècles a été, de son côté, largement accompagné par une idéologie d'opposition entre l'Homme et la Nature, la connaissance étant généralement perçue comme un instrument de domination de la Nature plutôt que comme un moyen de vivre en harmonie avec elle.","French"
"Cette époque a vu aussi se développer la philosophie du droit naturel, dont découlent notamment les droits de l'homme et selon laquelle l'Homme se verrait attribuer par nature des prérogatives immuables ; mais ici le paradoxe n'est qu'apparent, car dans ce contexte la notion de nature est employée dans le sens de nature humaine, et n'implique aucune espèce de « réconciliation » avec la Nature (la promotion des droits de l'homme est d'ailleurs, jusqu'à présent, indépendante de toute préoccupation environnementale)[26].","French"
"En fait, la distinction entre l'humain et le naturel repose essentiellement sur des notions historiques et subjectives, voire contradictoires.","French"
"La question de son bien-fondé universel reste ouverte.","French"
"La distinction (parfois conçue comme une opposition) a été inspirée et justifiée par le besoin, d'origine religieuse ou découlant de certaines formes d'humanisme, de représenter l'Homme comme un être en-dehors ou au-dessus de la Nature même si par ailleurs l'Homme n'est pas séparable de son environnement naturel avec lequel il est en interaction permanente et dont il ne peut pas plus s'affranchir que n'importe quelle autre espèce vivante[1].","French"
"Voir les thèmes suivants : La forêt, stratégiquement importante pour la fourniture du bois, a fait l'objet d'une protection foncière particulière, renforcée en France depuis Colbert au XVIIe siècle.","French"
"Récemment, le génome des espèces sauvages ou domestiques a pris une valeur juridique particulière avec une privatisation permise par « marques » de propriété d'hybrides et variétés végétales « créées » (ou isolées) par les semenciers puis les premières autorisations de brevetage du vivant.","French"
"Mais la faune, la flore, la fonge et les organismes vivant sont encore en France et dans de nombreux pays considéré par le législateur comme res nullius (chose sans propriétaire).","French"
"Depuis peu, et au niveau international, ils tendent cependant à être identifiés comme une partie du bien commun, qu'est la biodiversité, source de services écosystémiques ; ce qui donne une « valeur » nouvelle à la nature, notamment marquée en Europe par les directives Habitat ou Oiseaux.","French"
"La « Nature » a récemment dans plusieurs pays, dont en France acquis un droit de protection, puis de représentation, assimilable dans une certaine mesure et dans certains cas à celui des droits des « victimes ».","French"
"Ainsi, les aménageurs doivent prospectivement appliquer le principe « éviter > réduire > compenser » les impacts écologiques lors des grands projets[27].","French"
"Et, en cas de pollution ou de catastrophe, le pollueur doit maintenant prendre en charge des compensations et/ou réparations.","French"
"Théoriquement, cela se fait selon le principe pollueur-payeur, qui reste cependant difficile à appliquer quand la pollution est ancienne ou diffuse.","French"
"Le principe de « préjudice écologique » a été en France, en 2012, confirmé par la Cour de Cassation lors du procès de l'Erika.","French"
"La notion de nature renvoie a priori à l’idée d’un domaine ayant ses propres principes de développement, qui serait hors de l’action de l’homme.","French"
"Or, on réalise aujourd'hui que le changement climatique a une origine anthropique.","French"
"L’idée de nature n’est donc pas suffisante.","French"
"Il y a une complémentarité et une interaction entre la nature et les communautés humaines.","French"
"L’esquisse de cette complémentarité réciproque peut s'éclairer avec la notion de culture écologique.","French"
"On constate par exemple que les notions de patrimoine naturel et de patrimoine culturel sont intimement liées, en observant le patrimoine mondial de l'UNESCO qui dresse une liste de sites naturels et culturels.","French"
"La convention de 2007 de l'UNESCO souligne l'interaction des communautés humaines avec la nature, dans la définition qui a été donnée du patrimoine culturel immatériel : Voir aussi : Culture et nature La notion de culture recouvre deux sens : Le premier correspond à l’idée de civilisation.","French"
"Cette idée est aussi ancienne que l'histoire de l'humanité, mais a trouvé une nouvelle signification avec la Philosophie des Lumières.","French"
"Dans ce sens, la culture est le trait distinctif de l’espèce humaine, associé à ses savoirs et savoir-faire.","French"
"Cette conception française de la culture serait plutôt individualiste.","French"
"Le second est le sens allemand, émergeant sous l’influence du romantisme.","French"
"La culture est la configuration particulière de croyances coutumières, traits matériels, organisations sociales… elle est une totalité singulière, une sphère autonome incommensurables avec d’autres totalités.","French"
"Cette conception plus collective s'oppose à la conception française.","French"
"Dans Les Mots et les Choses, Michel Foucault définit l’anthropologie comme l’étude des rapports entre la nature et la culture.","French"
"Globalement on peut appréhender cette question en distinguant les anthropologies matérialistes et les anthropologies symbolistes.","French"
"Les anthropologies matérialistes s’intéressent aux fonctions structurantes de la vie matérielle.","French"
"L’idée sous-jacente est que la nature est un déterminant de base : elle y est définie en termes ethnocentrique, comme étant le moteur de la vie sociale.","French"
"On y trouve l’anthropologie marxiste des années 1970 en France, pour laquelle la nature est une donnée brute qui peut être appropriée ou transformée, et l’environnement naturel est une précondition de l’environnement économique.","French"
"On trouve aussi la sociobiologie et l’écologie culturelle, entre lesquelles on souligne un certain parallèle puisque pour les deux, la cause ultime des comportements revient au champ de la nature.","French"
"Dans tous les cas, pour les anthropologies matérialistes, la culture est une forme particulière d’adaptation à une nature qui serait partout un élément déterminant et conditionnant.","French"
"Les anthropologies symbolistes s’intéressent aux caractères symboliques de la vie sociale.","French"
"Elles mettent l’accent sur les aptitudes des hommes à créer un monde de signification et d’intentionnalités dépendant des déterminations brutes de la nature.","French"
"Dans Anthropologie Structurale 2, Lévi-Strauss dit que l’anthropologie est la discipline qui pense la relation entre la nature et la culture.","French"
"La dichotomie nature / culture soulevée, l’opposition nature / culture suggère deux possibilités.","French"
"Soit la culture est ce qui donne un sens à nature (la culture impose sa signification à la nature).","French"
"Soit la nature détermine les rapports sociaux (la nature donne forme à la culture).","French"
"La dichotomie nature / culture utilisée comme outil analytique est en partie dérivée de Claude Lévi-Strauss.","French"
"Il l’a notamment utilisée comme opérateur central pour décoder les mythologies.","French"
"Celui-ci a été reconnu pertinent par les ethnologues de ces sociétés amérindiennes.","French"
"La mythologie retrace la construction de la nature sur un fond initial d’indifférenciation culturelle (ainsi, dans les mythes amérindiens, au début les animaux et les hommes avaient la même apparence).","French"
"Chez Lévi-Strauss, l’opposition, là où elle est pertinente, c’est-à-dire dans les mythes, n’est qu’une façon de mettre une étiquette sur des contrastes.","French"
"L’écologie culturelle donne un crédit illimité à la nature.","French"
"L’anthropologie structurale, à ce propos, n’oppose pas une forme d’idéalisme mais aussi un naturalisme, mais un naturalisme de principe.","French"
"Lévi-Strauss n’a jamais varié dans l’idée que la nature conditionne les opérations intellectuelles, la nature devenant donc une construction empirique.","French"
"L’étude naturaliste doit permettre de comprendre la structure des groupes culturels.","French"
"Ce qui intéresse Lévi-Strauss est de rendre compte de la manière dont l’esprit opère dans des contextes culturels et géographiques distincts (ex : les Mythologiques).","French"
"La mythologie révèle dans une forme épurée les opérations d’un esprit qui n’est plus condamné à mettre en ordre, mais qui peut « jouer » avec les règles de fonctionnement de la pensée.","French"
"La dichotomie nature / culture est une spécificité culturelle occidentale développée en Europe à partir de la Renaissance puis en Occident moderne de Descartes à Darwin, qui s’est répandue dans le monde entier, en même temps que s’accroissait l’influence politique, culturelle et commerciale de l’Occident (Grandes découvertes, colonisation, science occidentale), mais qui n'est pas partagée universellement[1],[28].","French"
"Ce paradigme n’est pas simplement un outil analytique parmi d’autres, il est aussi la clef de voûte de l’épistémologie moderne.","French"
"Ainsi, Philippe Descola dans Par-delà nature et culture (2005) distingue quatre « modes d’identification » qui sont le totémisme, l’animisme, l'analogisme et le naturalisme.","French"
"Selon lui, seule la société naturaliste (occidentale) produit cette frontière entre soi et autrui à travers l’idée de « nature » dans le sens de « ce qui ne relève pas de la culture », ce qui ne relève pas des traits distinctifs de l’espèce humaine, et des savoirs et savoir-faire humains (une des quatre définitions énumérées plus haut)[1].","French"
"Son usage comme outil analytique en ethnologie a parfois été fécond.","French"
"Toutefois, et Descola l’a montré dans Par-delà nature et culture, l’idée de nature est étrangère à de nombreuses sociétés.","French"
"Wikipédia Écouter est une encyclopédie universelle et multilingue créée par Jimmy Wales et Larry Sanger le 15 janvier 2001.","French"
"Il s'agit d'une œuvre libre, c'est-à-dire que chacun est libre de la rediffuser.","French"
"Gérée en wiki dans le site web wikipedia.org grâce au logiciel MediaWiki, elle permet à tous les internautes d'écrire et de modifier des articles.","French"
"Elle est devenue en quelques années l'encyclopédie la plus fournie et la plus consultée au monde.","French"
"L'organisation à but non lucratif américaine Wikimedia Foundation est dépositaire de la marque Wikipedia.","French"
"Elle finance l'hébergement web de l'encyclopédie.","French"
"L'anglais a été la première langue utilisée, et Wikipédia en anglais compte plus de six millions d'articles début 2020.","French"
"Wikipédia en français, ouverte le 23 mars 2001, compte un peu plus de deux millions d'articles la même année.","French"
"Wikipédia existe en plus de 300 langues, dans une apparence unie, mais avec de grandes variations de contenus.","French"
"En mars 2000, Jimmy Wales met en ligne sur le Web une encyclopédie libre[1] appelée Nupedia.","French"
"Il bénéficie pour cela du soutien de la société Bomis, dont il est l'actionnaire majoritaire[2].","French"
"Larry Sanger est engagé dans cette société au titre de rédacteur en chef.","French"
"Comme Nupedia fonctionne avec un comité scientifique, la progression du nombre d'articles est très lente[3].","French"
"Le 2 janvier 2001, Larry Sanger discute avec le programmeur Ben Kovitz, qui lui explique le concept du wiki.","French"
"Vu la frustration occasionnée par la lenteur des progrès de Nupedia, Larry Sanger propose à Jimmy Wales de créer un wiki sous licence publique générale GNU afin d'accroître la vitesse de développement des articles, ce qui aboutit au lancement formel de Wikipédia le 15 janvier 2001[1],[2].","French"
"En effet, étymologiquement, le terme « Wikipédia » est un mot-valise issu de la fusion de deux termes : wiki, type de site Web collaboratif (d'après le mot hawaïen wikiwiki qui signifie « rapide »[4]), se référant au fait que l'encyclopédie a toujours vocation à s'améliorer rapidement et à être constamment active de par son mode de fonctionnement, et -pédia, dérivé du mot grec παιδεία, paideia, « instruction », « éducation ».","French"
"Ce nouveau projet devait servir à fournir du contenu textuel selon une méthode plus souple, permettant ensuite éventuellement d'alimenter Nupedia, après un passage par le filtre d'un comité d'experts.","French"
"La version française de Wikipédia est officiellement créée le 23 mars 2001.","French"
"Elle est la première version de Wikipédia dans une langue autre que l'anglais, suivie par les versions en allemand et en catalan[2].","French"
"À partir de ce moment, Larry Sanger travaille parallèlement sur Nupedia et Wikipédia.","French"
"Il participe à l'élaboration de la plupart des règles de fonctionnement de cette dernière[2].","French"
"En février 2002, la rétribution de son travail pour Nupedia et Wikipédia est supprimée du budget alloué par Bomis ; en conséquence de quoi il démissionne officiellement le 1er mars 2002 de ses fonctions sur les deux projets[a].","French"
"En 2003, la progression de Nupedia stagne, alors que Wikipédia se développe très rapidement.","French"
"Le 26 septembre 2003, Nupedia est définitivement fermée et son contenu intégré à Wikipédia, qui poursuit son expansion.","French"
"Selon Larry Sanger, Nupedia a échoué à cause d'une chaîne éditoriale trop lourde et de la difficulté à trouver des rédacteurs bénévoles[2].","French"
"Le 20 juin 2003, la Wikimedia Foundation est créée pour financer le soutien technique de Wikipédia[5].","French"
"Jimmy Wales intervient fin 2005 sur l'article « Wikipedia » de Wikipédia en anglais, pour retirer l'information selon laquelle Larry Sanger en était cofondateur, puisque Sanger a toujours été un salarié.","French"
"Cet événement donne lieu à de nombreux articles dans la presse anglophone, ainsi qu'à des images humoristiques sur le sujet[b].","French"
"Lors du 5e symposium international sur le journalisme en ligne, Jonathan Dee, du New York Times[6], et Andrew Lih[7] mentionnent l'importance de Wikipédia, non seulement comme une encyclopédie de référence mais aussi comme une ressource d'actualités très fréquemment mise à jour.","French"
"L'attention a cependant été attirée à de nombreuses reprises sur des problèmes éditoriaux internes à l'encyclopédie[8].","French"
"Lorsque le magazine Time a reconnu « Vous » (You) comme personnalité de l'année 2006, en reconnaissant l'accélération de la collaboration en ligne et l'interaction de millions d'utilisateurs dans le monde, il a cité Wikipédia comme l'un des trois exemples de services Web 2.0, avec YouTube et Myspace[9].","French"
"En 2015, la Fondation Wikimedia, qui héberge les données des Wikipédias sur ses serveurs, lance une initiative de « durabilité » afin de réduire les impacts environnementaux de ses activités[réf.","French"
"souhaitée].","French"
"Le 15 janvier 2021, à l'occasion des 20 ans d'existence de Wikipédia, les médias publient un grand nombre d'articles sur l'encyclopédie collaborative, son projet et son histoire.","French"
"L'encyclopédie est éditée sur le site wikipedia.org, qui est devenu en quelques années l'un des plus consultés au monde.","French"
"Les serveurs hébergeant le site sont financés par une fondation américaine, la Wikimedia Foundation.","French"
"Depuis son lancement officiel, Wikipédia est en grande partie modifiable par la plupart de ses lecteurs.","French"
"Les mêmes principes fondateurs de rédaction sont partagés par les différentes versions linguistiques, mais les pratiques d'écriture sont convenues indépendamment par les internautes pour chacune d'elles.","French"
"Plusieurs autres moyens de consulter l'encyclopédie avec internet ont vu le jour, tels que des sites web miroirs[10], un appareil électronique dédié, le WikiReader, ou des applications pour smartphone.","French"
"De 2012 à février 2018, le programme Wikipedia Zero a permis une diffusion gratuite de l’encyclopédie et des projets annexes dans les pays du Sud.","French"
"Grâce à un partenariat avec des opérateurs de téléphonie mobile, l’accès à Wikipédia sur téléphone portable n’était pas décompté du forfait[11].","French"
"Ce programme a été arrêté du fait de la faible audience de Wikipedia pour les pays concernés, et de l'inadéquation aux nouveaux types d'appareils téléphoniques.","French"
"La recherche de moyens techniques et économiques permettant de rendre accessibles les informations de Wikipédia par d'autres voies que le Web, est liée au projet d'une diffusion la plus large possible des connaissances.","French"
"Le projet de distribution sur papier était destiné en particulier aux personnes n'ayant pas les moyens de se raccorder à Internet.","French"
"La réalisation d'une version de Wikipédia en anglais sur papier, CD-ROM ou DVD fut initiée[c] en août 2003 par Jimmy Wales.","French"
"Jusqu'en 2014, il a été possible de commander une sélection d'articles de Wikipédia appelée « Livres », imprimée et reliée (pour laquelle la Fondation Wikimédia percevait 10 % sur les ventes brutes des ouvrages[12]).","French"
"Courant 2015, l'artiste Michael Mandiberg imprima 106 des 7 473 volumes correspondant à la version anglophone de l'encyclopédie dans le cadre d'un projet intitulé « Print Wikipedia »[13].","French"
"La version allemande de Wikipédia fut vendue sur CD-ROM, puis sur DVD à partir du deuxième semestre 2004 : le nombre de 10 000 CD-ROM vendus fut franchi en avril 2005.","French"
"En avril 2007, une sélection d'environ 2 000 articles de la version anglaise fut éditée sur CD-ROM par la société française Linterweb[14] .","French"
"À la même époque, le projet moulinWiki, initié par IESC-Geekcorps-Mali, proposa une version intégrale incluant tous les articles, sans les images, réunis sur une image disque de 554 Mo[15].","French"
"La diffusion d'un DVD d'une sélection d'articles Wikipédia en français a fait l'objet d'un projet équivalent au projet anglophone, mais il n'a pas abouti.","French"
"Un projet de diffusion de documents électroniques imprimables sur un sujet donné, Les Cahiers de Wikipédia, a lui aussi été abandonné.","French"
"Kiwix est l'un des principaux logiciels libres permettant de consulter Wikipédia à partir d'un ordinateur personnel sous Windows, Mac OS, GNU/Linux, iOS ou Android en mode hors connexion.","French"
"Il permet de lire un fichier au format ZIM contenant n'importe quelle version linguistique de Wikipedia et de la plupart de ses projets annexes (Wikiquote, Wikivoyage, etc.","French"
"), textes et illustrations comprises (la taille du fichier correspondant variant selon la version linguistique utilisée).","French"
"Le projet Afripédia avait notamment fait usage de ce logiciel : dans les campus universitaires d'Afrique dont la liaison internet ne disposait pas d'un débit suffisant pour permettre de consulter Wikipédia en ligne, le projet visait à la mise à disposition d'ordinateurs plug équipés de bornes Wi-Fi et d'une copie locale de Wikipédia.","French"
"Kiwix est également utilisé par la Human Rights Foundation en Corée du Nord, où la version coréenne de l'encyclopédie est introduite en contrebande par des dissidents[16].","French"
"Depuis 2016, des applications mobiles contenant le corpus médical de l'encyclopédie ont également fait leur apparition sous Android, toujours grâce à Kiwix, sous le nom de WikiMed.","French"
"Une autre manière de consulter Wikipédia hors ligne est d'utiliser les dumps (sauvegardes), qui sont disponibles en ligne et téléchargeables par tout un chacun.","French"
"Ils sont cependant particulièrement encombrants, dépassant souvent plusieurs dizaines, voire centaines de gigaoctets et nécessitent pour être utilisés une certaine compétence technique.","French"
"L'accès officiel à Wikipédia se charge automatiquement sur les plateformes iPhone, Android, WebOS, Opera Mini, NetFront (Sony Mobile, PlayStation) ou Wii.","French"
"Contrairement aux contributeurs anonymes, les utilisateurs inscrits peuvent modifier les articles, consulter leur liste de suivi, ajouter et enlever des articles de cette liste, etc.","French"
"Un bouton situé en bas de toutes les pages permet de basculer de la version bureau à la version mobile et réciproquement.","French"
"Il existe également des logiciels qui permettent de transformer le contenu de Wikipédia sous forme de fichiers consultables sur des assistants personnels, comme Webaroo avec Plucker.","French"
"L'appareil électronique WikiReader permet également la consultation hors-ligne de Wikipédia (en 2012, cet appareil n'est plus commercialisé en France[17]).","French"
"Wikipédia peut aussi être consultée grâce à l'application Android officielle[18], disponible sur le Play Store ou encore l'application iPhone officielle[19], disponible sur l'App Store.","French"
"Wikipédia a pour slogan : « Le projet d'encyclopédie librement distribuable que chacun peut améliorer ».","French"
"Ce projet est décrit par son cofondateur Jimmy Wales comme « un effort pour créer et distribuer une encyclopédie libre de la meilleure qualité possible à chaque personne sur la planète dans sa propre langue »[20].","French"
"Ainsi, Jimmy Wales proposa comme objectif que Wikipédia puisse atteindre un niveau de qualité au moins équivalent à celui de l'Encyclopædia Britannica.","French"
"C'est un exemple de collaboration massive à but non lucratif.","French"
"En revanche, Wikipédia n'a pas pour but de présenter des informations inédites, elle ne vise donc qu'à exposer des connaissances déjà établies et reconnues, s'appuyant sur des sources secondaires de qualité[21].","French"
"« Wikipédia » est un mot-valise conçu à partir de « wiki », un système de gestion de contenu de site web qui permet d'écrire facilement dans les pages consultées, et de « pédia », qui provient du mot « encyclopédie », présent dans de nombreuses langues, comme l'anglais et certaines graphies latines.","French"
"Les contributeurs francophones, ainsi que ceux de certaines autres versions linguistiques, utilisent un « é » aussi bien dans le nom dactylographié que dans le Logo de Wikipédia ; la plupart des autres communautés s'en tenant à l'écriture « Wikipedia »[21].","French"
"Wikipédia est réalisée collaborativement sur Internet via un « réseau coopératif » autoorganisé et sans frontières linguistiques[22].","French"
"Le système wiki de Wikipédia permet la création et la modification immédiates des pages par tous les visiteurs, même sans inscription.","French"
"Wikipédia fut la première encyclopédie généraliste à ouvrir, grâce à ce système, la modification de ses articles à tous les internautes.","French"
"Aucun article n'est considéré comme achevé, et Wikipédia se présente comme une encyclopédie en amélioration continue.","French"
"La constante surveillance des modifications est également ouverte à tous à travers le système wiki.","French"
"Il n'y a aucun système hiérarchique de validation ; aussi l'encyclopédie est-elle l'objet de nombreuses incompréhensions et critiques quant à la qualité et à la fiabilité de son contenu[23], et l'objet d'études sur la fiabilité de Wikipédia en anglais, la langue la plus développée.","French"
"Le projet se veut universel, en traitant tous les domaines de la connaissance, y compris la culture populaire[24].","French"
"Il se veut aussi multilingue[25] et gratuit[26] dans sa version en ligne, afin de favoriser l'accès du plus grand nombre à la connaissance.","French"
"Wikipédia est disponible sous licence libre, ce qui signifie que chacun est libre de la recopier, de la modifier[d] et de la redistribuer gratuitement et onéreusement.","French"
"Cette notion de contenu libre découle de celle de logiciel libre, formulée avant Wikipédia par la Free Software Foundation.","French"
"Jusqu'en 2009, le contenu textuel de Wikipédia était publié sous la Licence de documentation libre GNU (GFDL).","French"
"À partir de 2009, il est principalement publié sous licence Creative Commons paternité-partage des conditions initiales à l'identique 3.0 (CC BY-SA 3.0[27]), la GFDL devenant une licence secondaire disponible sous certaines conditions.","French"
"Les modifications apportées par les utilisateurs sont publiées sous les deux licences, et l'import de contenu uniquement sous licence Creative Commons BY-SA 3.0 est autorisé, mais il entraîne l'impossibilité de réutiliser globalement les pages concernées sous licence GFDL[e].","French"

"Toutes langues confondues, des centaines de sites web reprennent tout ou partie du contenu de Wikipédia[g].","French"
"Chaque site qui héberge une copie de Wikipédia a sa propre politique éditoriale ; dans Wikipédia, les contributeurs ont développé de nombreuses règles et recommandations pour viser la qualité[h].","French"
"Le contenu encyclopédique se veut respectueux de la « neutralité de point de vue », définie par Jimmy Wales comme le fait de « décrire le débat plutôt que d'y participer[28] ».","French"
"Tout contributeur à un article de Wikipédia doit s'efforcer de ne jamais prendre parti dans une discussion argumentée qu'il rapporte.","French"
"La neutralité de point de vue consiste à présenter objectivement les idées et les faits rapportés par des sources extérieures vérifiables et notoires, indépendamment des préjugés des rédacteurs des articles.","French"
"Sur Wikipédia, les règles d'écriture visent à convenir aux personnes rationnelles, même si celles-ci ne sont pas toujours du même avis.","French"
"La politique de neutralité de Wikipédia stipule que les articles doivent évoquer toutes les facettes d'une question controversée, et ne pas déclarer ni insinuer que l'un ou l'autre des points de vue est a priori le bon.","French"
"La neutralité de point de vue n'implique pas cependant une représentation égalitaire de toutes les opinions, Wikipédia accordant plus de place aux opinions les plus largement acceptées.","French"
"Par ses objectifs et son fonctionnement, le projet Wikipédia s'inscrit dans une série de filiations culturelles[2] : En revanche, Wikipédia est assez éloignée de l'Encyclopédie ou Dictionnaire raisonné des sciences, des arts et des métiers par sa volonté de présenter des informations neutres, alors que l'ouvrage conçu par Denis Diderot et Jean Le Rond d'Alembert se caractérisait au contraire par son fort engagement contre l'obscurantisme[32].","French"
"L'historien du livre Roger Chartier souligne cependant que Wikipédia « repose sur les contributions multiples d'une sorte de société de gens de lettres invisibles » tout en observant que « Diderot n'aurait sûrement pas accepté la simple juxtaposition des articles, sans arbre des connaissances ni ordre raisonné, qui [la] caractérise »[33].","French"
"Le succès de Wikipédia a poussé la communauté à développer d'autres sites en reprenant ses mécanismes de fonctionnement : Cette bibliothèque multimédia propose uniquement un contenu libre, publié soit sous licence libre[i], soit dans le domaine public aux États-Unis, dans le pays d'origine de l'œuvre, et dans celui du contributeur l'ajoutant au site.","French"
"Cette banque de données regroupe la majeure partie des schémas, photos, vidéos et sons libres qui servent à illustrer les articles de Wikipédia dans ses différentes versions linguistiques.","French"
"Créée le 7 septembre 2004, Wikimedia Commons dispose de plus de trente millions de fichiers début 2016.","French"
"Sa politique de licence libre a obligé le monde juridique à prendre position sur les droits d'auteur d'œuvres créées par des non-humains lors de la controverse du selfie du macaque[34].","French"
"Wikimedia Commons collabore avec des médiathèques afin de diffuser plus largement leurs fonds d'images libres, à travers Wikipédia notamment.","French"
"En décembre 2008, les archives fédérales du Bundestag allemand ont ainsi téléchargé 80 000 images vers ce site[j], puis en avril la bibliothèque du Land de Saxe fait un don de 250 000 images[k], et, en novembre 2009, le musée ethnographique d'Amsterdam Tropenmuseum a téléchargé 35 000 images concernant l'Indonésie[35].","French"
"Ces images, dont beaucoup ont une valeur historique, servent ensuite d'illustrations à des articles de Wikipédia, des sites web et des journaux en ligne.","French"
"Ce type de collaboration offre à ces bibliothèques et musées une plus grande diffusion de leur fonds d'images, et une révision de ces fonds par les internautes qui signalent les erreurs comme des descriptions incorrectes ou des confusions entre auteurs homonymes, et permettent la correction des autorités, les biographies succinctes identifiant les auteurs dans une collection d'archives.","French"

"Les pages de Wikipédia sont regroupées dans différents espaces de noms, tels que « Principal », « Discussion », « Aide » ou encore « Utilisateur »[l].","French"
"L'espace « Principal » contient les articles encyclopédiques, qui peuvent être rangés dans une ou plusieurs catégories, lesquelles peuvent être organisées selon une hiérarchisation arborescente et thématique (par exemple « Pays d'Europe », puis « Italie », puis « Ville d'Italie »)[m].","French"
"Les pages sont en outre reliées les unes aux autres par des hyperliens internes permettant au lecteur de se déplacer à travers l'encyclopédie[n].","French"
"D'autres hyperliens permettent de naviguer entre les différentes versions linguistiques ou de conduire vers ses projets frères, par exemple pour fournir une définition d'un mot sur le Wiktionnaire ou une galerie d'images sur Wikimedia Commons[o].","French"
"Un clic de souris sur les illustrations de Wikipédia conduit à une page de description du fichier multimédia indiquant notamment le nom de l'auteur et la licence sous laquelle il est publié.","French"
"Des hyperliens externes mènent aux sources d'information en ligne venant à l'appui de l'article[p].","French"
"Les articles proposent aussi souvent des liens externes vers les références ou la documentation en ligne permettant d'approfondir le sujet.","French"
"Ces liens sont classés en no follow (« ne pas suivre ») pour les robots d'indexation des moteurs de recherche, afin de décourager l'insertion de liens dans un but publicitaire[36].","French"
"Afin d'assurer la pérennité des liens vers ces sources, Internet Archive a réparé en 2018 près de 9 millions de liens brisés[37].","French"
"Sur chaque page, des onglets permettent d'accéder aux fonctions de modification, soit par l'intermédiaire d'un éditeur visuel, soit par l'intermédiaire du code source, le wikicode[q].","French"
"Un historique permet de lister les auteurs et de consulter les modifications successives de l'article par ses rédacteurs.","French"
"Ces modifications sont identifiées par l'adresse IP du rédacteur ou par son pseudonyme s'il s'est préalablement identifié[38].","French"
"À chaque article est rattachée une page de discussion permettant aux rédacteurs et lecteurs de discuter et de débattre de la rédaction de l'article[r].","French"
"Les différentes communautés linguistiques de rédacteurs de Wikipédia ont élaboré des règles, des conventions et des principes guidant la rédaction des articles qui leur sont propres[s].","French"

"La répartition montre une nette prédominance des articles culturels.","French"
"Les pourcentages qui suivent sont ceux de janvier 2008, les variations entre parenthèses représentent leur évolution depuis juillet 2006.","French"
"Dans l'intervalle, le nombre de pages et de catégories a plus que doublé : La Wikimedia Foundation permet aux différentes versions linguistiques de Wikipédia d'héberger directement du contenu multimédia (images, vidéo, cartes, plans, sons...).","French"
"Elle incite néanmoins les différentes communautés à déplacer le contenu libre vers une plate-forme multimédia commune à l'ensemble des 303 versions linguistiques de Wikipédia : Wikimedia Commons.","French"
"Cependant, de nombreuses images (celles dont le statut vis-à-vis du droit d'auteur varie selon les pays, ou celles qui sont protégées par des copyrights incompatibles avec un téléversement sous licence ouverte) n'y sont pas acceptées.","French"
"Chaque version linguistique s'est dotée de critères spécifiques et d'une doctrine réglementant l'hébergement de contenu non libre, comme des illustrations protégées par le droit d'auteur mais publiées grâce à des exceptions présentes dans certaines législations[u].","French"
"Par exemple, Wikipédia en anglais a adopté le principe américain du fair use[40] (« usage raisonnable », en français), contrairement à Wikipédia en français[41].","French"
"Afin d'augmenter le nombre d'images libres disponibles pour illustrer les articles, le concours photographique international Wiki Loves Earth propose de prendre des photos ayant pour sujet le Patrimoine naturel, puis à les téléverser dans le répertoire Wikimedia Commons.","French"
"Wikimédia Commons héberge plus de 56 millions d'images[42].","French"
"Depuis sa création, le contenu de l'encyclopédie Wikipédia n’a cessé de grandir, en quantité, dans des proportions difficilement imaginables à ses débuts.","French"
"Au départ comparable aux autres encyclopédies existantes, elle les a rapidement dépassées en taille et en couverture[43].","French"

"Il constitue le plus grand et le plus populaire des ouvrages de références générales d'Internet, avec un total de 160 millions de pages disponibles[45].","French"
"Ainsi, fin 2009, Wikipédia contenait déjà 28,5 millions d'articles, auxquels il convenait d'ajouter les documents de la médiathèque Wikimedia Commons, contenant 5,6 millions de fichiers.","French"

"Wikipédia est un projet multilingue composé de près de 300 projets linguistiques distincts[48].","French"
"Chaque version linguistique est gérée par des communautés de bénévoles différentes et bénéficie d'une certaine autonomie de fonctionnement.","French"
"Les règles d'édition peuvent par exemple varier d'une version linguistique à l'autre.","French"
"Au total, l'ensemble des versions linguistiques représente des milliards de modifications sur des dizaines de millions de pages encyclopédiques, construites par des centaines de milliers de contributeurs.","French"
"Une liste des Wikipédias actualisée régulièrement est disponible sur le site Méta-Wiki.","French"
"Certaines éditions de Wikipédia, telles que les éditions en cebuano et en waray-waray, ont un nombre d'articles très élevé malgré un nombre limité d'utilisateurs, en raison de l'utilisation d'un logiciel ou robot pour générer des articles[49].","French"
"Il existe également un classement qualitatif fondé sur l'existence et la taille des articles d'une liste arbitraire d'environ 1 000 articles que toute édition de Wikipédia devrait avoir[w].","French"
"Le projet Wikipédia ne se limite pas aux langues vivantes comptant un très grand nombre de locuteurs, officielles ou attachées à un pays.","French"

"Tout lecteur de Wikipédia est un rédacteur ou correcteur potentiel.","French"
"Fin 2008, un sondage est effectué par la Wikimedia Foundation et UNU-MERIT.","French"
"Environ 130 000 lecteurs et contributeurs de Wikipédia y ont répondu, principalement en langues anglaise, allemande et espagnole.","French"
"La moyenne d'âge des sondés est environ 26 ans.","French"
"Une fois les résultats lissés, environ 65 % d'entre eux se déclaraient seulement lecteurs, et 35 % contributeurs.","French"
"Parmi les contributeurs, 48 % d'entre eux avaient fait des études supérieures, et 20 % obtenu un master ou plus.","French"
"Ces contributeurs passent en moyenne 4,3 heures par semaine sur Wikipédia, et leurs motivations principales sont de partager le savoir et de corriger les erreurs[51].","French"
"Certains comptes utilisateurs sont utilisés par des logiciels, dits « robots » ou « bots », programmés pour assurer la maintenance des articles, par exemple pour corriger des erreurs communes d'orthographe ou de mise en forme, lutter contre les vandalismes ou encore, dans certaines éditions de Wikipédia, créer de nombreux nouveaux articles[49],[52].","French"
"En 2014, les robots ont effectué près de 15 % de l'ensemble des contributions[53].","French"
"Il leur arrive de mener des « guerres d'édition » entre eux, parfois pendant plusieurs années[54].","French"
"Les rédacteurs se répartissent généralement par communauté linguistique concentrée sur la rédaction de la version de Wikipédia correspondante, mais interviennent aussi souvent ponctuellement sur les versions de Wikipédia en d'autres langues, ou les projets frères de la Wikimedia Foundation.","French"
"Depuis 2008, les comptes enregistrés peuvent être unifiés : un seul compte sert ainsi à identifier l'utilisateur sur tous les projets de la Wikimedia Foundation.","French"
"Parmi les contributeurs, il y a toujours eu plus d'hommes que de femmes[55].","French"
"En 2010, une étude réalisée à partir d'une enquête auprès des contributeurs et contributrices et des travaux antérieurs sur le genre, l'expérience de l'internet et les compétences à contribuer suggère que ceci est dû en partie au fait que les hommes ont de manière générale plus développé certaines des compétences utiles dans l'Internet pour contribuer à ce type de projet[56],[57].","French"
"Un contributeur est classé « actif » tant qu'il fait au moins cinq modifications par mois.","French"
"Depuis 2007, le nombre de contributeurs actifs sur l'ensemble des versions linguistiques de Wikipédia a presque été divisé par deux[58].","French"
"Un rédacteur peut être identifié par son adresse IP, ou par son pseudonyme s'il l'a enregistré sur le site.","French"
"Plus de 85 millions d'éditeurs ont créé leur compte, 300 000 étant considérés comme actifs[59].","French"
"Au sein de Wikipédia, les comptes utilisateurs disposent de différents statuts techniques gérés par le logiciel MediaWiki et contrôlant les actions qui leur sont permises[x].","French"
"Les critères pour acquérir un statut et la façon de se servir des capacités fournies sont fixés indépendamment par chaque communauté.","French"
"Parmi ces statuts, les principaux sont : La Wikimedia Foundation fournit des statistiques mensuelles sur son site[z].","French"
"On trouve notamment la somme des nombres de contributeurs ayant fait au moins 100 modifications pour l'ensemble des éditions[60] : On trouve également la somme des nombres de contributeurs ayant fait au moins 5 modifications pour l'ensemble des éditions[61] : On trouve également le nombre de pages vues pour l'ensemble des éditions[62] : Les modifications apportées aux articles font l'objet de plusieurs niveaux de surveillance a posteriori, qui permettent de corriger les erreurs les plus évidentes.","French"
"Selon Le Figaro, le cofondateur de Wikipédia, Jimmy Wales, affirme ainsi qu'« en général, la correction d'une erreur ou d'une information fallacieuse a lieu en quelques heures, voire en quelques minutes »[63].","French"
"Une étude de l'université du Minnesota affirme que, jusqu'en 2006, sur deux millions de modifications problématiques, 42 % ont été réparées dans un temps qui rend peu probable leur lecture par un visiteur, alors qu'environ 11 % des vandalismes détectés persistaient après avoir été vus cent fois.","French"
"De la même manière, la grande majorité des vandalismes détectés avaient été corrigés après 15 révisions au plus[64].","French"
"En 2009, Dominique Cardon et Julien Levrel attribuent une partie de la réussite du mode de correction et du processus d'amélioration continue de Wikipédia à une gouvernance fondée sur la « vigilance participative »[65].","French"
"À un premier niveau, tous les changements sont accessibles en temps réel sur une page récapitulant les « modifications récentes ».","French"
"Ce flux est scruté en permanence par des volontaires, ainsi que par quelques automates[66].","French"
"Les vandalismes les plus évidents (écrasements de pages entières, messages d'insulte, graffiti) sont généralement détectés à ce stade, et corrigés dans les secondes ou minutes qui suivent par un retour à la version précédente.","French"
"Ce premier niveau de contrôle porte essentiellement sur la forme.","French"
"Les surveillants volontaires peuvent également corriger des problèmes évidents d'orthographe ou de style, et éventuellement effectuer un contrôle de cohérence rapide sur un ajout particulièrement suspect.","French"
"En 2006, 60 % des « vandalismes » étaient détectés facilement par des humains (modifications dénuées de sens, offensantes ou encore suppressions massives), mais certaines catégories de modifications semblaient plus délicates à repérer : désinformation, suppression partielle, spam et autres[64].","French"
"Le deuxième niveau de contrôle consiste, pour un rédacteur inscrit, à examiner sur sa « liste de suivi » (liste des pages qu'il a marquées pour les surveiller) les modifications apportées récemment.","French"
"Cet examen permet de détecter et corriger assez rapidement les principaux problèmes de fond : erreurs manifestes, ajouts hors sujet, ou manque d'objectivité ou de neutralité dans la formulation.","French"
"Les coauteurs de l'article peuvent ainsi contrôler de manière plus approfondie les ajouts suspects, si nécessaire en s'appuyant sur des sources de référence.","French"
"Quand ces deux premiers niveaux de contrôle conduisent à des corrections, le correcteur volontaire peut examiner ensuite l'ensemble des ajouts effectués par le même contributeur, ce qui peut lui permettre de rattraper des modifications ayant échappé aux deux premiers niveaux de contrôle.","French"
"Quand il apparaît qu'un contributeur « à problème » a trop souvent une contribution négative sur Wikipédia, il peut se faire interdire d'écriture sur toute l'encyclopédie : « Les administrateurs, élus parmi les contributeurs, ont le pouvoir de supprimer ou de protéger des pages, de bloquer ou d'exclure un contributeur à la suite d'une décision du comité d'arbitrage, lui aussi composé de membres choisis par la communauté »[63].","French"
"Les erreurs qui échappent à ces premiers niveaux de contrôle sont des erreurs peu évidentes, ou qui portent sur des articles marginaux, de faible avancement, et peu surveillés.","French"
"Ces erreurs peuvent rester des mois voire des années dans l'article, et restent d'autant plus longtemps que l'article est peu lu et peu modifié[63].","French"
"Elles peuvent être corrigées spontanément par un lecteur.","French"
"De plus, à la faveur d'une nouvelle modification, l'article repasse par les contrôles précédents, et les correcteurs volontaires peuvent décider à cette occasion de le relire en intégralité pour corriger d'éventuelles erreurs anciennes.","French"
"Le dernier niveau de contrôle, collectif, est formé par les projets d'amélioration d'articles rattachés à un thème donné, organisé autour d'un « portail ».","French"
"Dans ce cadre, les articles sont relus, complétés et corrigés, par des volontaires passionnés par ce thème.","French"
"Les articles qui bénéficient de ces relectures sont initialement corrigés, et continuent généralement à être suivis par l'équipe du « portail ».[réf.","French"
"nécessaire] Chaque communauté établit aussi des procédures pour labelliser les articles en fonction de critères spécifiques, ce processus conduit par exemple à deux catégories d'articles : « bon article »[aa] (« good article » sur Wikipédia en anglais) et « article de qualité »[ab] (« featured article » sur Wikipédia en anglais).","French"
"D'autres procédures sont développées et testées par les différentes communautés de langue, comme le projet WikiTrust, des filtres automatiques contrôlant le texte proposé à la publication, ou des versions de travail nécessitant une relecture avant d'être incorporés à la version publiée (flagged revision)[réf.","French"

"L'étude menée par des chercheurs de l'université Carnegie-Mellon et du Palo Alto Research Center sur l'année 2008[39] s'intéresse également à la contribution des différents thèmes de l'encyclopédie aux conflits, en décomptant le nombre d'annulations de modification, ramené à la taille de la catégorie correspondant au thème : Les annulations de modification sont plus nombreuses dans certains articles, dont l'ensemble ou une partie du contenu se trouve particulièrement controversé.","French"
"Une étude montre que ces articles diffèrent selon les langues de l'encyclopédie[67].","French"
"Dans l'encyclopédie Wikipédia en français, les dix articles les plus controversés selon le critère des annulations, étaient à fin mars 2010, les suivants : Le statut de Wikipédia en tant que source de référence est un sujet de controverses, en particulier à cause de son système de rédaction ouvert à tous.","French"
"L'audience grandissante de Wikipédia a conduit un grand nombre de personnes à formuler des avis critiques sur la fiabilité des informations présentées dans cette encyclopédie.","French"
"Ces critiques étant récurrentes, une page spéciale de Wikipédia est consacrée aux réponses de participants à Wikipédia aux objections les plus fréquentes[ac].","French"
"Les principales critiques portent sur : Les critiques de Wikipédia l'accusent d'incohérences, de partialité systémique et d'une forme d'anti-élitisme[68], et d'avoir une politique favorisant trop le consensus dans son processus éditorial[69].","French"
"La fiabilité et la précision de Wikipédia sont aussi des questions débattues[70].","French"
"D'autres critiques portent essentiellement sur sa sensibilité au vandalisme et à l'ajout de fausses informations[71], bien que des travaux aient suggéré que le vandalisme est généralement de courte durée[72],[64].","French"
"D'autres critiques se révèlent plutôt positives.","French"
"Ainsi, en juin 2009, le philosophe français Bernard Stiegler estime que Wikipédia, « passage obligé pour tout utilisateur d'Internet », est un « exemple frappant d'économie de la contribution » et que l'encyclopédie « a conçu un système d'intelligence collective en réseau »[73].","French"
"Des études ont été menées sur la qualité du contenu proposée par Wikipédia, et des comparaisons effectuées avec d'autres encyclopédies.","French"
"Ces évaluations fournissent généralement des conclusions positives pour Wikipédia, mais ces résultats font aussi l'objet de critiques[74].","French"
"Le traitement inégalitaire des hommes et des femmes tant en nombre d'articles qu'en qualité et neutralité du contenu, avec une présentation des femmes plus péjorative, fait l'objet d'analyses convergentes[75],[76],[77],[78].","French"
"Toutefois, les études ne concluent pas sur le fait de savoir si ce biais provient des contributeurs eux-mêmes, ou des sources qui leur sont disponibles[75].","French"
"En 2017, la journée internationale des droits des femmes du 8 mars a vu de nombreuses initiatives pour améliorer le nombre d'articles consacrés à des personnalités féminines[79],[80],[81],[82].","French"
"En octobre 2018, lors de l'attribution du Nobel de physique à Donna Strickland, son absence de Wikipédia fait réagir et suscite certaines critiques sur la représentativité des femmes dans l'encyclopédie, tout en pointant du doigt la responsabilité des médias et universitaires qui n'avaient pas préalablement donné de couverture « significative et durable » à cette chercheuse[83].","French"
"Une critique souvent formulée par la communauté transgenre est la transphobie de la communauté anglophone de Wikipédia[84].","French"
"Le refus de l'utilisation de sources primaires peut notamment mener à utiliser les deadnames ou à ne pas respecter l'identité de genre d'une personne, ce qui relève de la transphobie[85],[86].","French"
"La version de Wikipedia en anglais dispose de conventions de style à propos de l'identité de genre qui préconisent que l'article doit utiliser l'identité de genre exprimée par le sujet de l'article (dans la source la plus récente)[86].","French"
"Toutefois, il est à souligner que le magazine Marianne rappelle qu'en quelques heures, ""Ellen"" a été remplacé par ""Elliot"" dans les titres d'articles, sur la fiche wikipédia de Elliot Page[87].","French"
"La Wikimedia Foundation a fait part de son inquiétude quant au départ de personnes contribuant à Wikipédia en raison de harcèlement lié à leur identité de genre[86].","French"
"Par conséquent, Wikipedia adopte un code de conduite pour lutter contre le harcèlement suite aux problèmes comportementaux de certains de ses éditeurs qui aux fils de discussion tournent au pugilat voire au harcèlement par un membre de la communauté à l’encontre d’autres, notamment à l’encontre des femmes, des personnes de la communauté LGBT, etc.","French"
"Jusqu’à ce que le conseil d’administration en vienne à suspendre un administrateur pendant un an, et ce, à l’encontre de la tradition de la communauté qui règle généralement ses problèmes de manière collégiale[88].","French"
"Wikipédia et ses projets parallèles sont des wikis libres.","French"
"Le premier wiki est créé en 1995 par Ward Cunningham, qui l'appelle WikiWikiWeb[ad].","French"
"Un wiki est un site web dynamique, dont les visiteurs autorisés peuvent modifier les pages qu'ils lisent avec leur navigateur web.","French"
"Sur Wikipédia, par exemple, la syntaxe utilisée pour modifier une page est beaucoup plus simple que celle du Hypertext Markup Language, et elle est censée permettre un apprentissage rapide.","French"
"Le fonctionnement de Wikipédia est assuré par le logiciel libre MediaWiki, une plate-forme wiki adaptée à Wikipédia, écrite en PHP et utilisant une base de données MySQL.","French"
"MediaWiki est sous licence GNU GPL et est en 2010 utilisé par tous les projets Wikimedia ainsi que par de nombreux autres sites wikis.","French"
"À l'origine, Wikipédia utilisait le logiciel UseModWiki, développé par Clifford Adams en Perl, et requérant l'usage de la camel case pour la création de liens entre les articles.","French"
"À partir de janvier 2002, la version en anglais de Wikipédia utilise un logiciel développé par Magnus Manske, écrit en PHP — les versions dans les autres langues étant restées sous le logiciel UseModWiki.","French"
"À partir de l'été 2002, tous les sites sont progressivement migrés vers MediaWiki.","French"
"Les informations contenues dans Wikipédia, toutes langues confondues, sont conservées dans une base de données et peuvent être téléchargées[ae].","French"

"Les serveurs sont organisés en trois couches : Plusieurs sites web, comme Ganglia[af], permettent de consulter diverses informations sur le fonctionnement des serveurs, notamment la charge des processeurs, la mémoire occupée… Une description précise de l'architecture des serveurs est difficile, car elle change très fréquemment en raison des améliorations régulièrement apportées pour répondre au très fort trafic engendré par la consultation de Wikipédia.","French"
"Cet aspect de Wikipédia est géré par le personnel technique de la Wikimedia Foundation.","French"
"La Wikimedia Foundation possède les différentes marques (Wikipedia, Wikimedia…), les serveurs, les sites web, et agit comme hébergeur web.","French"
"Des associations nationales, ayant pour but de promouvoir Wikipédia et le libre partage des connaissances, existent dans plusieurs pays.","French"
"Elles reprennent généralement l'intitulé « Wikimedia » (Wikimédia Belgique, Wikimédia France[ag], Wikimédia Suisse[ah], etc.).","French"
"Ces associations sont reconnues comme associations locales par la Wikimedia Foundation, mais n'y sont pas juridiquement liées, et n'ont aucune responsabilité sur le contenu de Wikipédia.","French"
"Elles sont généralement désignées comme le chapter (chapitre) pour un pays donné.","French"
"Des associations de ce type sont présentes en Angleterre, en Allemagne, en Argentine, en Australie, en Autriche, en France, à Hong Kong, en Israël, en Italie, aux Pays-Bas, en Pologne, en République tchèque, en Russie, en Serbie, en Suède, en Suisse et à Taïwan[91].","French"

"« apprentissage machine[1],[2] »), apprentissage artificiel[1] ou apprentissage statistique est un  champ d'étude de l'intelligence artificielle qui se fonde sur des approches mathématiques et statistiques pour donner aux ordinateurs la capacité d'« apprendre » à partir de données, c'est-à-dire d'améliorer leurs performances à résoudre des tâches sans être explicitement programmés pour chacune.","French"
"Plus largement, il concerne la conception, l'analyse, l'optimisation, le développement et l'implémentation de telles méthodes.","French"
"L'apprentissage automatique comporte généralement deux phases.","French"
"La première consiste à estimer un modèle à partir de données, appelées observations, qui sont disponibles et en nombre fini, lors de la phase de conception du système.","French"
"L'estimation du modèle consiste à résoudre une tâche pratique, telle que traduire un discours, estimer une densité de probabilité, reconnaître la présence d'un chat dans une photographie ou participer à la conduite d'un véhicule autonome.","French"
"Cette phase dite « d'apprentissage » ou « d'entraînement » est généralement réalisée préalablement à l'utilisation pratique du modèle.","French"
"La seconde phase correspond à la mise en production : le modèle étant déterminé, de nouvelles données peuvent alors être soumises afin d'obtenir le résultat correspondant à la tâche souhaitée.","French"
"En pratique, certains systèmes peuvent poursuivre leur apprentissage une fois en production, pour peu qu'ils aient un moyen d'obtenir un retour sur la qualité des résultats produits.","French"
"Selon les informations disponibles durant la phase d'apprentissage, l'apprentissage est qualifié de différentes manières.","French"
"Si les données sont étiquetées (c'est-à-dire que la réponse à la tâche est connue pour ces données), il s'agit d'un apprentissage supervisé.","French"
"On parle de classification ou de classement[3] si les étiquettes sont discrètes, ou de régression si elles sont continues.","French"
"Si le modèle est appris de manière incrémentale en fonction d'une récompense reçue par le programme pour chacune des actions entreprises, on parle d'apprentissage par renforcement.","French"
"Dans le cas le plus général, sans étiquette, on cherche à déterminer la structure sous-jacente des données (qui peuvent être une densité de probabilité) et il s'agit alors d'apprentissage non supervisé.","French"
"L'apprentissage automatique peut être appliqué à différents types de données, tels des graphes, des arbres, des courbes, ou plus simplement des vecteurs de caractéristiques, qui peuvent être continues ou discrètes.","French"
"Depuis l'antiquité, le sujet des machines pensantes préoccupe les esprits.","French"
"Ce concept est la base de pensées pour ce qui deviendra ensuite l'intelligence artificielle, ainsi qu'une de ses sous-branches : l'apprentissage automatique.","French"
"La concrétisation de cette idée est principalement due à Alan Turing (mathématicien et cryptologue britannique) et à son concept de la « machine universelle » en 1936[4], qui est à la base des ordinateurs d'aujourd'hui.","French"
"Il continuera à poser les bases de l'apprentissage automatique, avec son article sur « L'ordinateur et l'intelligence » en 1950[5], dans lequel il développe, entre autres, le test de Turing.","French"

"En 2016, un système d'intelligence artificielle à base d'apprentissage automatique nommé LipNet parvient à lire sur les lèvres avec un grand taux de succès[15],[16].","French"
"Les algorithmes utilisés permettent, dans une certaine mesure, à un système piloté par ordinateur (un robot éventuellement), ou assisté par ordinateur, d'adapter ses analyses et ses comportements en réponse, en se fondant sur l'analyse de données empiriques provenant d'une base de données ou de capteurs.","French"
"La difficulté réside dans le fait que l'ensemble de tous les comportements possibles compte tenu de toutes les entrées possibles devient rapidement trop complexe à décrire (on parle d'explosion combinatoire).","French"
"On confie donc à des programmes le soin d'ajuster un modèle pour simplifier cette complexité et de l'utiliser de manière opérationnelle.","French"
"Idéalement, l'apprentissage visera à être non supervisé, c'est-à-dire que la nature des données d'entrainement n'est pas connue[17].","French"
"Ces programmes, selon leur degré de perfectionnement, intègrent éventuellement des capacités de traitement probabiliste des données, d'analyse de données issues de capteurs, de reconnaissance (reconnaissance vocale, de forme, d'écriture…), de fouille de données, d'informatique théorique… L'apprentissage automatique est utilisé pour doter des ordinateurs ou des machines de systèmes de : perception de leur environnement (vision, reconnaissance d'objets tels des visages, schémas, langages naturels, caractères manuscrits, formes)  ; moteurs de recherche ; aide aux diagnostics, médical notamment, bio-informatique, chémoinformatique ; interfaces cerveau-machine ; détection de fraudes à la carte de crédit, cybersécurité, analyse financière, dont analyse du marché boursier ; classification des séquences d'ADN ; jeu ; génie logiciel ; adaptation de sites Web ; locomotion de robots ; analyse prédictive en matière juridique et judiciaire… Exemples : Les algorithmes d'apprentissage peuvent se catégoriser selon le mode d'apprentissage qu'ils emploient : Ce sont, dans ce domaine : Ces méthodes sont souvent combinées pour obtenir diverses variantes d'apprentissage.","French"
"L'utilisation de tel ou tel algorithme dépend fortement de la tâche à résoudre (classification, estimation de valeurs…).","French"
"L'apprentissage automatique est utilisé pour un large spectre d'applications, par exemple : La qualité de l'apprentissage et de l'analyse dépendent du besoin en amont et a priori de la compétence de l'opérateur pour préparer l'analyse.","French"
"Elle dépend aussi de la complexité du modèle (spécifique ou généraliste), de son adéquation et de son adaptation au sujet à traiter.","French"
"In fine, la qualité du travail dépendra aussi du mode (de mise en évidence visuelle) des résultats pour l'utilisateur final (un résultat pertinent pourrait être caché dans un schéma trop complexe, ou mal mis en évidence par une représentation graphique inappropriée).","French"
"Avant cela, la qualité du travail dépendra de facteurs initiaux contraignants, liées à la base de données : L'apprentissage automatique ne se résume pas à un ensemble d'algorithmes mais suit une succession d'étapes[25].","French"
"L’apprentissage automatique demande de grandes quantités de données pour fonctionner correctement.","French"
"Il peut s’avérer difficile de contrôler l’intégrité des jeux de données, notamment dans le cas de données générées par les réseaux sociaux[26].","French"
"La qualité des « décisions » prises par un algorithme d’AA dépend non seulement de la qualité (donc de leur homogénéité, fiabilité, etc.)","French"
"des données utilisées pour l’entrainement mais surtout de leur quantité.","French"
"Donc, pour un jeu de données sociales collecté sans attention particulière à la représentation des minorités, l’AA est statistiquement injuste vis-à-vis de celles-ci.","French"
"En effet, la capacité à prendre de « bonnes » décisions dépend de la taille des données, or celle-ci sera proportionnellement inférieure pour les minorités.","French"
"L’AA ne distingue actuellement pas cause et corrélation de par sa construction mathématique, et est incapable d’aller au-delà du cadre imposé par ses données, il n’a donc pas de capacité d’extrapolation.","French"
"Un exemple : si on apprend à un algorithme de retourner le chiffre qu’on lui donne (application identité) en l’entraînant uniquement avec les nombres 1 à 5, il sera incapable de correctement répondre à 6.","French"
"Il est donc incapable d’extrapoler.","French"
"L’utilisation d’algorithmes d’apprentissage automatique demande donc d’avoir conscience du cadre de données que l’on a utilisé pour l’apprentissage lors de leur utilisation.","French"
"Il est donc prétentieux d’attribuer des vertus trop grandes aux algorithmes d’apprentissage automatique[27].","French"
"La voiture autonome paraît réalisable grâce à l’apprentissage automatique et les énormes quantités de données générées par la flotte automobile, de plus en plus connectée.","French"
"Contrairement aux algorithmes classiques (qui suivent un ensemble de règles prédéterminées), l’apprentissage automatique apprend ses propres règles[28].","French"
"Les principaux innovateurs dans le domaine insistent sur le fait que le progrès provient de l’automatisation des processus.","French"
"Ceci présente le défaut que le processus d’apprentissage automatique devient privatisé et obscur.","French"
"Privatisé, car les algorithmes d’AA constituent des gigantesques opportunités économiques, et obscurs car leur compréhension passe derrière leur optimisation.","French"
"Cette évolution peut potentiellement nuire à la confiance du public envers l’apprentissage automatique, mais surtout au potentiel à long terme de techniques très prometteuses[29].","French"
"La voiture autonome présente un cadre test pour confronter l’apprentissage automatique à la société.","French"
"En effet, ce n’est pas seulement l’algorithme qui se forme à la circulation routière et ses règles, mais aussi l’inverse.","French"
"Le principe de responsabilité est remis en cause par l’apprentissage automatique, car l’algorithme n’est plus écrit mais apprend et développe une sorte d’intuition numérique.","French"
"Les créateurs d’algorithmes ne sont plus en mesure de comprendre les « décisions » prises par leurs algorithmes, ceci par construction mathématique même de l’algorithme d’apprentissage automatique[30].","French"
"Dans le cas de l’AA et les voitures autonomes, la question de la responsabilité en cas d’accident se pose.","French"
"La société doit apporter une réponse à cette question, avec différentes approches possibles.","French"
"Aux États-Unis, il existe la tendance à juger une technologie par la qualité du résultat qu’elle produit, alors qu’en Europe le principe de précaution est appliqué, et on y a plus tendance à juger une nouvelle technologie par rapport aux précédentes, en évaluant les différences par rapport à ce qui est déjà connu.","French"
"Des processus d’évaluation de risques sont en cours en Europe et aux États-Unis[29].","French"
"La question de responsabilité est d’autant plus compliquée que la priorité chez les concepteurs réside en la conception d’un algorithme optimal, et non pas de le comprendre.","French"
"L’interprétabilité des algorithmes est nécessaire pour en comprendre les décisions, notamment lorsque ces décisions ont un impact profond sur la vie des individus.","French"
"Cette notion d’interprétabilité, c’est-à-dire de la capacité de comprendre pourquoi et comment un algorithme agit, est aussi sujette à interprétation.","French"
"La question de l’accessibilité des données est sujette à controverse : dans le cas des voitures autonomes, certains défendent l’accès public aux données, ce qui permettrait un meilleur apprentissage aux algorithmes et ne concentrerait pas cet « or numérique » dans les mains d’une poignée d’individus, de plus d’autres militent pour la privatisation des données au nom du libre marché, sans négliger le fait que des bonnes données constituent un avantage compétitif et donc économique[29],[31].","French"
"Dans les années 2000-2010, l'apprentissage automatique est encore une technologie émergente, mais polyvalente, qui est par nature théoriquement capable d'accélérer le rythme de l'automatisation et de l'autoaprentissage lui-même.","French"
"Combiné à l'apparition de nouveaux moyens de produire, stocker et faire circuler l'énergie, ainsi qu'à l'informatique ubiquiste, il pourrait bouleverser les technologies et la société (comme l'ont fait la machine à vapeur et l'électricité, puis le pétrole et l'informatique lors des révolutions industrielles précédentes.","French"
"L'apprentissage automatique pourrait générer des innovations et des capacités inattendues, mais avec un risque selon certains observateurs de perte de maitrise de la part des humains sur de nombreuses tâches qu'ils ne pourront plus comprendre et qui seront faites en routine par des entités informatiques et robotisées.","French"
"Ceci laisse envisager des impacts spécifiques complexes et encore impossibles à évaluer sur l'emploi, le travail et plus largement l'économie et les inégalités.","French"
"Selon le journal Science fin 2017 : « Les effets sur l'emploi sont plus complexes que la simple question du remplacement et des substitutions soulignées par certains.","French"
"Bien que les effets économiques du BA soient relativement limités aujourd'hui et que nous ne soyons pas confrontés à une « fin du travail » imminente comme cela est parfois proclamé, les implications pour l'économie et la main-d'œuvre sont profondes »[32].","French"
"Il est tentant de s'inspirer des êtres vivants sans les copier naïvement[33] pour concevoir des machines capables d'apprendre.","French"
"Les notions de percept et de concept comme phénomènes neuronaux physiques ont d'ailleurs été popularisés dans le monde francophone par Jean-Pierre Changeux.","French"
"L'apprentissage automatique reste avant tout un sous-domaine de l'informatique, mais il est étroitement lié opérationnellement aux sciences cognitives, aux neurosciences, à la biologie et à la psychologie, et pourrait à la croisée de ces domaines, nanotechnologies, biotechnologies, informatique et sciences cognitives, aboutir à des systèmes d'intelligence artificielle ayant une assise plus vaste.","French"
"Des enseignements publics ont notamment été dispensés au Collège de France, l'un par Stanislas Dehaene[34] orienté sur l'aspect bayésien des neurosciences, et l'autre par  Yann LeCun[35] sur les aspects théoriques et pratiques de l'apprentissage profond.","French"
"Un algorithme peut être biaisé lorsque son résultat dévie par rapport à un résultat neutre, loyal ou équitable.","French"
"Dans certains cas, les biais algorithmiques peuvent conduire à des situations de discrimination[36].","French"
"Les algorithmes d'apprentissage automatique posent des problèmes d'explicabilité globale du système.","French"
"Si certains modèles comme la régression linéaire ou la régression logistique ont un nombre de paramètres limité et peuvent être interprétés, d'autres types de modèle comme les réseaux de neurones artificiels n'ont pas d'interprétation évidente[37].","French"
